Kennedy Jr.‘s health and human services, which historically has had nothing to do with offshore wind farms. The reasoning? A conspiracy theory that wind turbines emit electromagnetic fields that could harm human beings.\nLast week, we published Gabriella Burnham’s investigation into the controversy behind Vineyard Wind.

Here is a look back at what excited Linux enthusiasts the most on Phoronix during September.\nIn addition to XFS enabling online fsck by default, Bcachefs being stripped from the mainline Linux kernel, and Btrfs improvements making for a notable first few days of the Linux 6.18 window, there's more. The EXT4, EROFS, and NTFS3 drivers are bringing the latest batch of file-system changes for Linux 6.18.\nOpenSUSE Leap 16.0 is out today as this community Linux distributiom built from the same sources as SUSE Linux Enterprise 16.\nLinus Torvalds has come out strong against proposed support for RISC-V big endian capabilities within the Linux kernel.\nThe Academy Software Foundation's OpenColorIO \"OCIO\" project as a color management solution for motion picture production and related uses has added support for the Vulkan API.\nChanges merged this week to the Mesa PowerVR Vulkan driver now allow it to support all of the functionality required by the Vulkan 1.2 specification.\nOpenZFS 2.4-rc2 was released on Tuesday as the latest stepping stone toward the big OpenZFS 2.4 feature release.\nDue to rising demand around system memory being pushed up in large part by HBM for AI applications, Raspberry Pi announced price increases on select products to help offset the rising LPDDR costs.\n30 September\nAfter originally hoping to publish the open-source code last year, today AMD published the initial openSIL code for enabling Phoenix SoCs to make use of this in-development CPU silicon initialization alternative to AGESA.\nQualcomm engineers have posted the initial patches for bringing up the newest Adreno 800 series graphics IP within the open-source MSM Linux kernel Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver.\nIn addition to the IEEE-1394 Firewire support still being maintained within the Linux kernel, another Apple tech still seeing code churn within the Linux kernel years later are the HFS and HFS+ file-systems. For the Linux 6.18 kernel are more fixes to the HFS/HFS+ support.\nDebuting today is the newest NVIDIA 580 Linux driver series release.\nMerged as part of the kernel hardening updates for Linux 6.18 is not a direct hardening improvement but rather a long overdue enhancement to the kernel configuration \"Kconfig\" system. The introduction of this new \"transitional\" keyword for Kconfig options can ease the process of renaming Kconfig options across kernel versions with less breakage/headaches for those maintaining their own kernel configurations/builds.\nThe XFS file-system updates have been merged for the Linux 6.18 merge window.\nSo far on this last day of Q3'2025 we are at just over 800 original Linux news articles for the quarter on Linux hardware and open-source software. Here is a look back at what proved to be most popular for the quarter.\nWhile IEEE-1394 Firewire hardware in the wild is increasingly rare, modern Linux IEEE-1394 subsystem maintainer Takashi Sakamoto has committed to maintaining Firewire support until 2029. With the in-development Linux 6.18 kernel there are more incremental improvements to this code.\nJust a friendly reminder that today is the last day for those wishing to join Phoronix Premium at a discounted rate.

Joining Phoronix Premium gets you ad-free access, multi-page articles on a single page, custom forum avatar support, and other benefits all while helping for operations to continue during this difficult period for the web/ad industry.\nThe Error Detection And Correction \"EDAC\" subsystem continues seeing a lot of new hardware support and code churn across AMD, Intel, and Arm hardware platforms for the Linux kernel. With Linux 6.18 there are several notable additions.\n29 September\nWith Linux 6.17 was the decision by Linus Torvalds to mark Bcachefs as \"externally maintained\" and not accept any new Bcachefs code into the mainline kernel but keeping the existing code within the tree. That was useful for those relying on Bcachefs to still boot a mainline kernel at least. Now for Linux 6.18, the Bcachefs code was removed from the mainline kernel.\nFollowing AMD announcing the end of the AMDVLK Vulkan driver development in favor of focusing on the Mesa RADV driver for Linux systems, Red Hat engineer David Airlie who was one of the co-lead developers of the RADV driver shared some interesting insight on NVK as the open-source NVIDIA Vulkan driver being developed within Mesa.\nIntroduced this year with the Linux 6.16 kernel was the new functionality for reporting to users when running on outdated Intel CPU microcode since it can pose security vulnerability issues and/or functionality problems. The Linux kernel support for propagating this \"old_microcode\" reporting via sysfs relies on a static list of microcode versions corresponding to different Intel CPU generations. For the Linux 6.18 kernel this list is being updated to reflect modern baselines for Intel recommendations on CPU microcode.\nWineConf as the annual Wine developer conference, for this open-source software allowing Windows games and applications to run on Linux, took place this weekend in The Hague. Several interesting talks took place including the usual keynote by Wine project leader Alexandre Julliard.\nLinux ACPI and power management maintainer Rafael Wysocki today sent out all of the feature updates and changes intended for the now-started Linux 6.18 merge window. There are some new Intel additions as well as for the growing range of different ARM-based SoCs and other hardware.\nEarlier this year NVIDIA announced Newton as an open-source physics engine focused on robotic simulations. This physics engine was developed by NVIDIA in cooperation with Google DeepMind and Disney Research. Today it's been contributed to the Linux Foundation.\nBack in August Intel released LLM-Scaler 1.0 as part of Project Battlematrix for help getting generative AI \"GenAI\" workloads running on Arc (Pro) B-Series graphics cards. Out today are two new LLM Scaler beta releases for further enhancing the AI capabilities on Intel Battlemage GPUs.\nBlender 5.0 is working its way toward an official release in mid-November and is soon transitioning from its alpha to beta stage. Among the key changes with Blender 5.0 are its Vulkan renderer being in good shape overall, HDR support when using Vulkan and Wayland on Linux, and other enhancements. Today some brief details were shared around the current state of the Vulkan support for Blender 5.0.\nBack during the Linux 6.17 merge window the RISC-V changes were rejected as \"garbage\" for being submitted too late in the merge window and with some code choices that upset Linus Torvalds. With lessons learned, the RISC-V changes for Linux 6.18 were submitted today during the first official day of this new kernel cycle.\nBuilding off yesterday's release of Linux 6.17, the GNU Linux-libre 6.17-gnu kernel is now available for this downstream kernel variant that strips away support for loading non-free microcode and other elements not aligned with the Free Software Foundation principles. This ultimately ends up limiting the hardware support available with most of today's modern hardware requiring microcode/firmware but alas here is the latest release with a fresh round of de-blobbing.\nWith Q3 coming to an end this week, here is a look back at the most popular Linux hardware reviews and featured multi-page benchmark articles during the third quarter of this year on Phoronix.\nWhile the Linux 6.18 kernel merge window is just getting formally started following yesterday's Linux 6.17 release, one thing is already quite clear: there is a a lot of new Rust programming language code set to head into Linux 6.18.\nControl-Flow Enforcement Technology \"CET\" is coming to the virtualized world with support for running within KVM guest VMs on Linux 6.18+. This CET virtualization support works for both AMD and Intel processors.\n28 September\nAs expected, Linus Torvalds just released the Linux 6.17 kernel on-schedule as the kernel version powering Ubuntu 25.10, Fedora 43, and other upcoming Linux distribution releases and rolling releases.\nAhead of the stable Linux 6.17 kernel release expected in the coming hours, Bcachefs lead developer Kent Overstreet put out a blog post around the current multi-Linux distribution support for the out-of-tree DKMS packages for this copy-on-write file-system, some of their plans moving forward, and still aiming to graduate from the \"experimental\" phase at the end of the year.\nGraalVM has been an interesting and performant Java JDK that over time added support for additional programming languages and execution models. Following their 2022 announcement that GraalVM CE Java code would be donated to OpenJDK, Oracle recently announced that moving forward GraalVM will focus on non-Java languages.\nThere is a lot coming for AMD processors with the Linux 6.18 kernel. Of the early pull requests submitted in advance of the planned Linux 6.17 kernel release later today, there are a number of changes already lined up with some exciting AMD CPU feature additions for the next kernel version. These AMD changes for Linux 6.18 are all the more important with that kernel expected to become this year's Long Term Support (LTS) kernel version.\nAdding to the list of pull requests submitted early in advance of the Linux 6.18 merge window opening are several cryptography-related improvements. In particular, some nice performance optimizations once again for the Linux kernel.\nIntroduced two years ago was the Intel/Codeplay oneAPI Construction Kit for helping to bring SYCL support to new hardware. As part of that the oneAPI Construction Kit was brought to RISC-V and other platforms. Out this week is now oneAPI Construction Kit 5.0 and sadly it drops Vulkan API support.\nFollowing the release earlier this year of the Fish 4.0 shell that was ported from C++ to Rust, Fish 4.1 was released this weekend as the next major feature release.\nThe Linux kernel's audit subsystem/framework for greater insight into system activity for security purposes will now be able to properly cope with multiple Linux Security Modules (LSMs).\nAll of the ARM64 feature changes intended for the Linux 6.18 merge window have been submitted in advance.

With its next release, Unvanquished has been ported to the SDL3 library and is working well natively on Wayland.\nThirteen years after the AMD GCN 1.0 \"Southern Islands\" GPUs initially launched as the Radeon HD 7000 series, recently there has been an effort to improve the support for both GCN 1.0 and the GCN 1.1 graphics processors with their open-source Linux driver stack. This recent effort has been led by one of the developers on Valve's Linux graphics team.\nLinux engineer at Microsoft Christian Brauner sent out his set of 12 pull requests touching the VFS portion of the Linux kernel. These changes for the Linux 6.18 kernel include one pull request that touches the writeback code to address a situation of lockups being reported by users when systemd units read lots of files.\nAmong the early pull requests submitted already to Linus Torvalds in advance of the Linux 6.18 merge window opening soon is the Btrfs file-system updates.

Notable now for this post-49.0 time is libadwaita adding an adaptive sidebar widget.\nBack in June it was announced by Canonical that for the Ubuntu 25.10 release they would be raising the RISC-V baseline to the RVA23 profile even with barely any available RISC-V platforms supporting that newer RISC-V profile. That change is still going ahead and leaves Ubuntu 25.10 on RISC-V currently only supporting the QEMU virtualized target.\nWith Linux 6.17 expected for release this weekend, the Linux 6.18 merge window will in turn kick-off for its usual two week dance. Here is a look at some of the features on our radar that are expected to be merged for Linux 6.18, which is also likely to be the 2025 LTS kernel version.\nVulkan 1.4.328 is now available as the latest specification update to this high performance graphics and compute API from The Khronos Group.\nThe Linux 6.17 kernel is tracking well for its planned stable release on Sunday. Here is a look back at some of the most interesting changes to find with this next kernel version.\nI noticed a number of benchmarks failing to run on Ubuntu 25.10 this week with reported checksum errors on the files... I quickly realized it's due to the recent Rust Coreutils transition for Ubuntu 25.10 causing some major breakage for those relying on Makeself archives.\nAfter being on a hiatus for more than one year and going through several rounds of Habana Labs driver maintainers due to Intel layoffs, there finally is some updated \"habanalabs\" AI accelerator kernel driver code slated to go into the upcoming Linux 6.18 kernel cycle.

Backed by the leaders in AI, GitHub Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With GitHub Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on: value, innovation, and happiness.\nGitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use GitHub Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.\nGitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, GitHub Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.\nWho is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?\nGitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, student, faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.\n\nWhat languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?\nGitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.\nGitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.\nDoes GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?\nNo, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.\nWhen thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.\nWhen thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.\nTo generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.\nTo generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.\nTo generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the GitHub Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies.

Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:\nDeliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations\nDeliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations\nTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness\nTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness\nEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational\nEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational\nThese practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ( DPA) , which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.\nGitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:\nBilling and account management\nBilling and account management\nTo comply with and resolve legal obligations\nTo comply with and resolve legal obligations\nFor abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service\nFor abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service\nTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives\nTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives\nTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,\nTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,\nFor details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement .\nHow long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?\nIf and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:\nAccess through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:\nPrompts and Suggestions: Not retained\nPrompts and Suggestions: Not retained\nUser Engagement Data: Kept for two years.\nUser Engagement Data: Kept for two years.\nFeedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.\nFeedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.\nAll other GitHub Copilot access and use:\nPrompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.\nPrompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.\nUser Engagement Data: Kept for two years.\nUser Engagement Data: Kept for two years.\nFeedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.\nFeedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.\n\nWhy do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?\nRetaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.\nDoes GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?\nYes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.\nDoes GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?\nWhile we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.\nHow does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?\nThese actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement .\n\nResponsible AI\nWhat are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?\nThe primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:\nCopyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.\nWhat about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.\nOur experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.\nIn Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see \" Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com \". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.\nDoes GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?\nYes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.\nGitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.\nGitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.\nWith the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.\nWith the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.\nIn addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.\nIn addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.\n\nDoes GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?\nYes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.\nWho owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?\nWe don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).\nIf a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.\nIf a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.\nGitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.\nGitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.\n\nCan GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?\nPublic code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials , SQL injections , and path injections . Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.\nIs GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?\nNo. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.\nThe product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.\nThe product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.\nIdentifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.\nIdentifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section.

Backed by the leaders in AI, GitHub Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With GitHub Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on: value, innovation, and happiness.\nGitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use GitHub Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.\nGitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, GitHub Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.\nWho is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?\nGitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, student, faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.\n\nWhat languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?\nGitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.\nGitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.\nDoes GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?\nNo, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.\nWhen thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.\nWhen thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.\nTo generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.\nTo generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context.

Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:\nDeliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations\nDeliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations\nTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness\nTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness\nEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational\nEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational\nThese practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ( DPA) , which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.\nGitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:\nBilling and account management\nBilling and account management\nTo comply with and resolve legal obligations\nTo comply with and resolve legal obligations\nFor abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service\nFor abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service\nTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives\nTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives\nTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,\nTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,\nFor details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement .\nHow long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?\nIf and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose.

The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.\nDoes GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?\nYes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.\nDoes GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?\nWhile we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.\nHow does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?\nThese actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement .\n\nResponsible AI\nWhat are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?\nThe primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:\nCopyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.\nWhat about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.\nOur experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.\nIn Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see \" Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com \". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.\nDoes GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?\nYes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.\nGitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.\nGitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.\nWith the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.\nWith the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.\nIn addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.\nIn addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.\n\nDoes GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?\nYes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.\nWho owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?\nWe don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).\nIf a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.\nIf a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.\nGitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.\nGitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion.

For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.\n\nCan GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?\nPublic code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials , SQL injections , and path injections . Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.\nIs GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?\nNo. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.\nThe product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.\nThe product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight.

Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:\nDeliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations\nDeliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations\nTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness\nTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness\nEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational\nEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational\nThese practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ( DPA) , which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.\nGitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:\nBilling and account management\nBilling and account management\nTo comply with and resolve legal obligations\nTo comply with and resolve legal obligations\nFor abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service\nFor abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service\nTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives\nTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives\nTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,\nTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,\nFor details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement .\nHow long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?\nIf and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose.

The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.\nDoes GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?\nYes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.\nDoes GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?\nWhile we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.\nHow does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?\nThese actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement .\n\nResponsible AI\nWhat are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?\nThe primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:\nCopyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.\nWhat about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.\nOur experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.\nIn Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see \" Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com \". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.\nDoes GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?\nYes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.\nGitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.\nGitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.\nWith the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.\nWith the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.\nIn addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.\nIn addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.\n\nDoes GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?\nYes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.\nWho owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?\nWe don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).\nIf a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.\nIf a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.\nGitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.\nGitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion.

For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.\n\nCan GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?\nPublic code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials , SQL injections , and path injections . Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.\nIs GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?\nNo. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.\nThe product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.\nThe product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.\nIdentifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.\nIdentifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section.

Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:\nDeliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations\nDeliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations\nTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness\nTroubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness\nEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational\nEnhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational\nThese practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ( DPA) , which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.\nGitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:\nBilling and account management\nBilling and account management\nTo comply with and resolve legal obligations\nTo comply with and resolve legal obligations\nFor abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service\nFor abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service\nTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives\nTo generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives\nTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,\nTo produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,\nFor details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the GitHub Privacy Statement .\nHow long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?\nIf and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose.

The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.\nDoes GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?\nYes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.\nDoes GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?\nWhile we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.\nHow does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?\nThese actions are available to Copilot users as described in the GitHub Privacy Statement .\n\nResponsible AI\nWhat are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?\nThe primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:\nCopyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.\nWhat about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.\nOur experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.\nIn Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see \" Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com \". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.\nDoes GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?\nYes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.\nGitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.\nGitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.\nWith the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.\nWith the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.\nIn addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.\nIn addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.\n\nDoes GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?\nYes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code referencing feature as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.\nWho owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?\nWe don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).\nIf a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.\nIf a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.\nGitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.\nGitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion.

For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.\n\nCan GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?\nPublic code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or                        idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also                        synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that                        either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials , SQL injections , and path injections . Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.\nIs GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?\nNo. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.\nThe product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.\nThe product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.\nIdentifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.\nIdentifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section.

Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum .\nDoes GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?\nGitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid                        synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter                        system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.\nWill GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?\nGiven public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.\nWhat data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?\nGitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft.

He spoke about his\nrecent work on the project at Kangrejos 2025 . The next day, Alejandra González\nled a discussion about Rust's normal linter, Clippy . The two tools offer complementary approaches to analyzing Rust\nkernel code, although both need some additional direction and support from\nkernel developers to reach their full potential.\nFull Story ( comments: 2 )\n\n[ $ ] Development statistics for 6.17\nThe 6.17 development cycle ended on September 28 with the release of the 6.17 kernel.  This cycle brought in 13,089 non-merge changesets, a\nslowdown from its predecessor but still within the normal bounds for recent\nkernels.  The time has come for a look at where those changes came from,\nwith a bit of a side trip into bug statistics.\nFull Story ( comments: 4 )\n\n[ $ ] Managing encrypted filesystems with dirlock\nAs with a mobile phone, a portable gaming device like the Steam Deck can contain\nlots of personal information that the owner would like to keep\nsecret—especially given that such devices can do far more than gaming.\nAlberto Garcia worked with his colleagues at Igalia and people at\nValve, the company behind the Steam gaming platform, to come\nup with a new tool to manage encrypted filesystems for SteamOS , which is a Linux\ndistribution optimized for gaming.  Garcia gave a talk about that tool, dirlock , at Open\nSource Summit Europe , which was held in Amsterdam in late August.\nIn the talk, he looked at the design process for\nthe encrypted-files feature, the alternatives considered, and why they made\nthe choices \nthey did.\nFull Story ( comments: 15 )\n\n[ $ ] Jumping into openSUSE Leap 16\n\nThe openSUSE project is nearing the release of Leap 16 , its\nfirst major release since openSUSE Leap 15\nin May 2018 . This release brings some changes to the\ncore of the distribution aside from the usual software upgrades; YaST has been retired ,\nSELinux has replaced AppArmor as the default mandatory access control\n(MAC) system, and more. If all goes according to plan, Leap 16\nfinal should be released in early October, with planned support\nthrough 2031.\nFull Story ( comments: 11 )\n\n[ $ ] The phaseout of the mmap() file operation\nThe file_operations structure in the kernel is a set of function pointers implementing, as the\nname would suggest, operations on files.  A subsystem that manages objects\nwhich can be represented by a file descriptor will provide a file_operations structure providing implementations of the various\noperations that a user of the file descriptor may want to carry out.  The mmap() method, in particular, is invoked when user space calls the mmap() system call to map the object behind a file descriptor into its address\nspace.  That method, though, is currently on its way out in a multi-release\nprocess that started in 6.17.\nFull Story ( comments: 2 )\n\n[ $ ] LWN.net Weekly Edition for September 25, 2025\nThe LWN.net Weekly Edition for September 25, 2025 is available.\nInside this week's LWN.net Weekly Edition\nFront : Debian stable bug; Canceling async Rust; CHERI Linux; Time-slice extension; Multikernel; Revocable references; Blender 4.5.\nBriefs : Bluefin LTS; RPM 6.0.0; Tails 7.0; Rust 1.90.0; Infrastructure costs; Quotes; ...\nAnnouncements : Newsletters, conferences, security updates, patches, and more.\n\n[ $ ] Canceling asynchronous Rust\n\nAsynchronous Rust code has what Rain Paharia calls a \" universal cancellation\nprotocol \", meaning that any asynchronous code can be interrupted in the same\nway. They claim\nthat this is both a useful feature when used deliberately, and a source of\nerrors when done by accident. They presented\nabout this problem at RustConf 2025 , offering a handful of techniques to avoid introducing bugs into\nasynchronous Rust code.\nFull Story ( comments: 29 )\n\n[ $ ] CHERI with a Linux on top\nThe Capability\nHardware Enhanced RISC Instructions (CHERI) project is a rethinking of\ncomputer architecture in order to improve system security.  Carl Shaw gave\na presentation at Linux\nSecurity Summit Europe (LSS EU) about CHERI and the efforts to get\nLinux running on it.  He introduced capabilities ,\nwhich are a mechanism for access control, and outlined their\nhistory, which goes back many decades at this point, then looked more\nspecifically at the CHERI project and what it will take to apply the security constraints of capabilities to an operating system like Linux.\nFull Story ( comments: 8 )\n\n[ $ ] An unstable Debian stable update\n\nA bug in a recent release of systemd's network manager caused\nheadaches for people managing systems that have a virtual LAN (VLAN)\ninterface on a bridge; something one might want to do, for example,\nwhen configuring network interfaces for virtual machines. The bug\naffected several Debian users when upgrading the systemd package\nfrom v257.7-1 to v257.8-1. The updated package is part of the Debian 13.1 release, and the bug has snared enough users to cause a minor\nstir—due in no small part to the maintainer's response as much\nas the bug itself.\nFull Story ( comments: 135 )\n\nAlpine Linux plans /usr merge\n\nThe Alpine Linux project has announced plans to change its base filesystem hierarchy:\nIn the future, /lib , /bin , and /sbin will be symbolic links to their /usr counterparts, and every package\nshall be installed under the /usr paths. For now, /usr/bin and /usr/sbin will continue to be independent paths,\nbut that might change if the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) gets\nupdated.\nThe merge will take place in the upcoming Alpine 3.23 release\nplanned for November; non-merged systems will be considered\nunsupported when 3.22 is at its end of life in May 2027.\n\nComments (2 posted)\n\nSecurity updates for Wednesday\nSecurity updates have been issued by AlmaLinux (kernel, kernel-rt, mysql:8.0, and openssh), Debian (libcommons-lang-java, libcommons-lang3-java, libcpanel-json-xs-perl, libjson-xs-perl, libxml2, open-vm-tools, and u-boot), Fedora (bird, dnsdist, mapserver, ntpd-rs, python-nh3, and rust-ammonia), Oracle (kernel and mysql:8.0), Red Hat (cups, postgresql:12, and postgresql:13), SUSE (cJSON-devel, gimp, kernel-devel, kubecolor, open-vm-tools, openssl-1_1, openssl-3, and ruby3.4-rubygem-rack), and Ubuntu (linux-azure-5.15 and openssl, openssl1.0).\nFull Story ( comments: none )\n\nOpenSUSE Leap 16 released\nThe openSUSE\nLeap 16 release is now available.\n\nSee our look at this release for more\ninformation.\nComments (none posted)\n\nRadicle 1.5.0 released\nVersion 1.5.0 of the Radicle peer-to-peer Git collaboration platform has been\nreleased.

This action was motivated by conflict with the project's steering committee (SC), which has repeatedly overridden the moderation team, leading the team members to decide that they could not continue acting as moderators. Arian Van Putten, speaking for the whole team, writes:\nThe SC has also shown, in private and public conversations, their lack of understanding of basic principles of community management and open communication. They have mistaken quiet and a lack of controversy for success and peace. They have consistently become upset when there is criticism, and gone quiet on crucial issues in between. We have some fundamental conflicts in this community, which absolutely require discussion. Meanwhile, discussion with the SC has only become less effective.\nWe think that the goal of moderation should not be to avoid difficult conversations - it's to navigate those difficult conversations in ways that remain safe and constructive. We believe we've made considerable progress as a community on making those conversations happen, and we believe they need to happen more for the project to grow, not be suppressed. We thank everyone for the growth that we have seen, and for their efforts to avoid personal focus in discussion, especially recently.\nThe NixOS project has had problems with community moderation stretching back more than a year . With the next steering council election coming up soon, it will be interesting to see whether the community selects a council that feels differently or not.\nComments (34 posted)\n\nSecurity updates for Monday\nSecurity updates have been issued by AlmaLinux (avahi, cups, firefox, gnutls, golang, httpd, kernel, libtpms, mysql, opentelemetry-collector, php:8.2, podman, postgresql:13, postgresql:15, python3, python3.11, python3.12, python3.9, thunderbird, and udisks2), Debian (firefox-esr, gimp, nncp, node-tar-fs, and squid), Fedora (chromium, firebird, python-azure-keyvault-securitydomain, python-azure-mgmt-security, and python-microsoft-security-utilities-secret-masker), Red Hat (httpd:2.4, kernel, kernel-rt, and mod_http2), SUSE (aide, apache2-mod_security2, chromedriver, cloud-init, docker, gdk-pixbuf, git, google-osconfig-agent, govulncheck-vulndb, gstreamer-plugins-base, iperf, kernel, krb5, krita, luajit, net-tools, nvidia-open-driver-G06-signed, pam, postgresql17, python311, rust-keylime, sevctl, tor, tree-sitter-ruby, and udisks2), and Ubuntu (curl, ghostscript, inetutils, python2.7, and qtbase-opensource-src).\nFull Story ( comments: none )\n\nF-Droid and Google's Developer Registration Decree\nThe F-Droid project has posted an\nurgent message regarding Google's plan to require developer\nregistration to install apps on Android devices.\n\nIf it were to be put into effect, the developer registration decree\n\twill end the F-Droid project and other free/open-source app\n\tdistribution sources as we know them today, and the world will be\n\tdeprived of the safety and security of the catalog of thousands of\n\tapps that can be trusted and verified by any and all.

He notes that the shortlog for the changes since -rc7 are pretty tame:\nOther than that, there' the usual driver fixlets (GPU and networking\ndominate as usual, but \"dominate\" is still pretty small), there's some\nminor random other driver updates, some filesystem noise, and core\nkernel and mm.\nAnd some selftest updates.\nSignificant features in this release include better control over x86 Spectre\nmitigations,\nlive patching support on 64-bit Arm platforms,\na number of pidfd\nimprovements ,\nthe removal of special support for\nuniprocessor systems, initial support for proxy execution,\nexperimental large-folio support in the Btrfs filesystem,\nthe file_getattr() and file_setattr() system calls , and\nsupport for the DualPI2\ncongestion-control protocol .\nSee the LWN merge-window summaries \n( part 1 , part 2 ) for more information.\nIn addition, KernelNewbies has a look at the changes that went into 6.17.\nComments (11 posted)\n\n--> More news items\nCopyright © 2025, Eklektix, Inc.

Look for a link at the bottom of this page or in the site menu to manage or withdraw consent in privacy and cookie settings.\nConsent\nDo not consent\nManage options\nData preferences\nManage your data\nYou can choose how your personal data is used. Vendors want your permission to do the following:\nTCF vendors\nStore and/or access information on a device\nCookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.\nUse limited data to select advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.\nCreate profiles to personalise content\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\nUse profiles to select personalised content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\nMeasure advertising performance\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.\nMeasure content performance\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\nDevelop and improve services\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.\nUse limited data to select content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).\nEnsure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors\nYour data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.\nDeliver and present advertising and content\nCertain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.\nSave and communicate privacy choices\nThe choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.\nMatch and combine data from other data sources\nInformation about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nLink different devices\nIn support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).\nIdentify devices based on information transmitted automatically\nYour device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.\nUse precise geolocation data\nWith your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nYou can choose your data preferences.

Look for a link at the bottom of this page or in the site menu to manage or withdraw consent in privacy and cookie settings.\nConsent\nDo not consent\nManage options\nData preferences\nManage your data\nYou can choose how your personal data is used. Vendors want your permission to do the following:\nTCF vendors\nStore and/or access information on a device\nCookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.\nUse limited data to select advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.\nCreate profiles to personalise content\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\nUse profiles to select personalised content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\nMeasure advertising performance\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.\nMeasure content performance\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\nDevelop and improve services\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.\nUse limited data to select content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).\nEnsure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors\nYour data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.\nDeliver and present advertising and content\nCertain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.\nSave and communicate privacy choices\nThe choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.\nMatch and combine data from other data sources\nInformation about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nLink different devices\nIn support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).\nIdentify devices based on information transmitted automatically\nYour device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.\nUse precise geolocation data\nWith your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nYou can choose your data preferences.

Look for a link at the bottom of this page or in the site menu to manage or withdraw consent in privacy and cookie settings.\nConsent\nDo not consent\nManage options\nData preferences\nManage your data\nYou can choose how your personal data is used. Vendors want your permission to do the following:\nTCF vendors\nStore and/or access information on a device\nCookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.\nUse limited data to select advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.\nCreate profiles to personalise content\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\nUse profiles to select personalised content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\nMeasure advertising performance\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.\nMeasure content performance\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\nDevelop and improve services\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.\nUse limited data to select content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).\nEnsure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors\nYour data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.\nDeliver and present advertising and content\nCertain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.\nSave and communicate privacy choices\nThe choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.\nMatch and combine data from other data sources\nInformation about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nLink different devices\nIn support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).\nIdentify devices based on information transmitted automatically\nYour device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.\nUse precise geolocation data\nWith your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nYou can choose your data preferences. This site or app wants your permission to do the following:\nSite or app\nMeasure content performance\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests.

Look for a link at the bottom of this page or in the site menu to manage or withdraw consent in privacy and cookie settings.\nConsent\nDo not consent\nManage options\nData preferences\nManage your data\nYou can choose how your personal data is used. Vendors want your permission to do the following:\nTCF vendors\nStore and/or access information on a device\nCookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.\nUse limited data to select advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.\nCreate profiles to personalise content\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\nUse profiles to select personalised content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\nMeasure advertising performance\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached.

This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.\nCreate profiles to personalise content\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\nUse profiles to select personalised content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\nMeasure advertising performance\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.\nMeasure content performance\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\nDevelop and improve services\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.\nUse limited data to select content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).\nEnsure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors\nYour data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.\nDeliver and present advertising and content\nCertain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.\nSave and communicate privacy choices\nThe choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.\nMatch and combine data from other data sources\nInformation about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nLink different devices\nIn support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).\nIdentify devices based on information transmitted automatically\nYour device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.\nUse precise geolocation data\nWith your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nYou can choose your data preferences.

Look for a link at the bottom of this page or in the site menu to manage or withdraw consent in privacy and cookie settings.\nConsent\nDo not consent\nManage options\nData preferences\nManage your data\nYou can choose how your personal data is used. Vendors want your permission to do the following:\nTCF vendors\nStore and/or access information on a device\nCookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.\nUse limited data to select advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.\nCreate profiles to personalise content\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\nUse profiles to select personalised content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\nMeasure advertising performance\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.\nMeasure content performance\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\nDevelop and improve services\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.\nUse limited data to select content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).\nEnsure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors\nYour data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.\nDeliver and present advertising and content\nCertain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.\nSave and communicate privacy choices\nThe choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.\nMatch and combine data from other data sources\nInformation about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nLink different devices\nIn support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).\nIdentify devices based on information transmitted automatically\nYour device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.\nUse precise geolocation data\nWith your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nYou can choose your data preferences.

Vendors want your permission to do the following:\nTCF vendors\nStore and/or access information on a device\nCookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.\nUse limited data to select advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.\nCreate profiles to personalise content\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\nUse profiles to select personalised content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\nMeasure advertising performance\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.\nMeasure content performance\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\nDevelop and improve services\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.\nUse limited data to select content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).\nEnsure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors\nYour data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.\nDeliver and present advertising and content\nCertain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.\nSave and communicate privacy choices\nThe choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.\nMatch and combine data from other data sources\nInformation about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nLink different devices\nIn support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).\nIdentify devices based on information transmitted automatically\nYour device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.\nUse precise geolocation data\nWith your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nYou can choose your data preferences.

Look for a link at the bottom of this page or in the site menu to manage or withdraw consent in privacy and cookie settings.\nConsent\nDo not consent\nManage options\nData preferences\nManage your data\nYou can choose how your personal data is used. Vendors want your permission to do the following:\nTCF vendors\nStore and/or access information on a device\nCookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.\nUse limited data to select advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.\nCreate profiles to personalise content\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\nUse profiles to select personalised content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\nMeasure advertising performance\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.\nMeasure content performance\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests.

This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.\nCreate profiles to personalise content\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\nUse profiles to select personalised content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\nMeasure advertising performance\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.\nMeasure content performance\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\nDevelop and improve services\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.\nUse limited data to select content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).\nEnsure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors\nYour data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.\nDeliver and present advertising and content\nCertain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.\nSave and communicate privacy choices\nThe choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.\nMatch and combine data from other data sources\nInformation about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nLink different devices\nIn support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).\nIdentify devices based on information transmitted automatically\nYour device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.\nUse precise geolocation data\nWith your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nYou can choose your data preferences.

This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.\nCreate profiles to personalise content\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\nUse profiles to select personalised content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\nMeasure advertising performance\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.\nMeasure content performance\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\nDevelop and improve services\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.\nUse limited data to select content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).\nEnsure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors\nYour data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.\nDeliver and present advertising and content\nCertain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.\nSave and communicate privacy choices\nThe choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.\nMatch and combine data from other data sources\nInformation about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nLink different devices\nIn support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).\nIdentify devices based on information transmitted automatically\nYour device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.\nUse precise geolocation data\nWith your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nYou can choose your data preferences.

Look for a link at the bottom of this page or in the site menu to manage or withdraw consent in privacy and cookie settings.\nConsent\nDo not consent\nManage options\nData preferences\nManage your data\nYou can choose how your personal data is used. Vendors want your permission to do the following:\nTCF vendors\nStore and/or access information on a device\nCookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.\nUse limited data to select advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).\nCreate profiles for personalised advertising\nInformation about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.\nUse profiles to select personalised advertising\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.\nCreate profiles to personalise content\nInformation about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.\nUse profiles to select personalised content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.\nMeasure advertising performance\nInformation regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.\nMeasure content performance\nInformation regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.\nUnderstand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\nDevelop and improve services\nInformation about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.\nUse limited data to select content\nContent presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).\nEnsure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors\nYour data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.\nDeliver and present advertising and content\nCertain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.\nSave and communicate privacy choices\nThe choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.\nMatch and combine data from other data sources\nInformation about your activity on this service may be matched and combined with other information relating to you and originating from various sources (for instance your activity on a separate online service, your use of a loyalty card in-store, or your answers to a survey), in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nLink different devices\nIn support of the purposes explained in this notice, your device might be considered as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).\nIdentify devices based on information transmitted automatically\nYour device might be distinguished from other devices based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.\nUse precise geolocation data\nWith your acceptance, your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) may be used in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\nYou can choose your data preferences.

The Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected about TLF employees or other TLF personnel.\nFor purposes of the GDPR, The Linux Foundation is the controller of your personal information. Where processing of personal information is undertaken by our affiliates, subsidiaries and related entities, they are a joint controller with The Linux Foundation for your personal information.\nCapitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use or, if you engage with LFX, then those defined in the LFX Platform Use Agreement (as applicable, the “Terms”). Specific details about the collection, processing and sharing of personal information by LFX is available in the LFX Privacy Policy Addendum . In this Privacy Policy, “personal information” includes references to “personal data” as defined under applicable laws. Your use of our Sites and Services, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this Policy and the relevant Terms, including the applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes.  The Terms are incorporated by reference into this Policy.\nPersonal Information That TLF Collects\nWe collect personal information directly from individuals, from third parties, and automatically through the Sites and Services. You do not have to provide us your personal information.  However, if you choose not to disclose certain information, we will not be able to provide you with access to certain services or features, including account registration, event registration, training and certification programs, or participation in certain aspects of our open source projects.\nRegistration Information. We collect personal information when you register for an account, a conference or other events or programs:\nLinux Foundation ID, Account and Profile Information. Users may sign up for, request, or order our Services and may register to receive materials on our Sites. Users may also create a “Linux Foundation ID” (also called an “LF Login” or “LF ID”), which is a single sign-on account which is used for common access to many of our Services, including LFX. Personal information collected on the Sites includes community forum content, profiles, photographs, names, forwarding information for “linux.com” email forwarding, unique identifiers (e.g., social media handles or usernames), information about your current and past employment affiliations, contact and billing information (e.g., email address, preferred pronoun, postal address, telephone, fax), and transaction information. In order to access certain personalized services on the Sites, you may be asked to also create and store a username and password for an account from TLF, and/or to link your Linux Foundation ID account with other providers’ social accounts (such as Facebook, Google, LinkedIn or GitHub).  Also, in order to tailor TLF’s subsequent communications to users and continuously improve the Sites’ operations and services, TLF may also ask users to provide additional optional information regarding their interests, demographics, experience and detailed contact preferences.\nLFX. To register for and participate in the LFX platform and related Services, users must have an active Linux Foundation ID and account (see above for information collected related to account registration). Certain personal information is processed by LFX solely as to individuals who sign up to participate in the applicable Services, while other personal information is processed by LFX in connection with all individuals who interact with the Linux Foundation and its Projects. Specific details about the collection, processing and sharing of personal information by LFX is available in the LFX Privacy Policy Addendum .\nEvents Registration. When you register for one of our events (e.g., conferences and summits) to participate as an attendee, a speaker or a sponsor, we collect personal information that includes name, company, contact information, and other information. We may also collect other optional personal information such as likes, interests, preferred pronoun, dietary restriction, size preferences for conference attire gifts and other background information.  In addition, if you provide it, we may collect (1) personal information about disabilities, medical conditions and allergies in order to provide appropriate accommodations for attendees, and (2) personal information about your citizenship, date of birth, and passport details if you request assistance from us with obtaining a visa letter to travel to one of our events.\nFor in-person events requiring attendees to be vaccinated against COVID-19, in order to provide a safer environment for attendees and staff, we may collect information to verify your identity and COVID-19 vaccination status. We may collect this information via direct verification of identity and vaccination status documents by TLF staff or third-party contractors, and/or through the use of third-party vaccination status apps and service providers.\nTraining and Certification Exam Registration .  When you participate in one of our training or certification programs, we collect registration-related personal information that includes name, company, certifications, contact information, and other information depending on the circumstances.\nRegistration for Project Resources and TLF Resources. You can register to receive access to various resources provided by TLF and its Projects regarding the open source ecosystem, open source project development, collaboration and best practices. This includes providing us with personal information such as your email address and name to receive newsletters, mailing list postings and social media postings, to view webinars, and to access other resources made available by TLF and its Projects.\nYour Contributions to Open Source Projects .\nAttribution, Provenance and Integrity . When you contribute source code, documentation or other content to one of our Projects (whether on your own behalf or through contributions made as part of your employment services to your employer), we collect and store the information and content that you contribute. This includes the contents of those contributions, as well as information required to confirm the provenance of intellectual property contained in those contributions, and personal information that you make publicly available in the record of the contribution pursuant to sign-offs under the Developer Certificate of Origin ( https://developercertificate.org/ ). Some Projects require additional agreements or information pursuant to their intellectual property policies; in such cases we collect and store information related to your acceptance of those agreements. We may also collect information relating to your participation in technical, governance or other Project-related meetings.\nOther Project-related Content. The content you provide in relation to Projects also includes materials that you make publicly available in connection with Project development, collaboration and communication, such as on mailing lists, blogs, Project wiki pages and issue trackers, and related services.\nApplicants for TLF Internships or Employment . We collect and store personal information relating to individuals who apply to participate in one or more of our Project-related internships, or for employment with TLF. Separately, as described in the LFX Privacy Policy Addendum , LFX Mentorship provides a platform for mentors and mentees to connect and conduct mentorships; however, these mentorships are not offered by, supervised by or administered by TLF, and participation in a mentorship does not constitute a form of employment or internship with or any related rights towards TLF. The personal information collected and stored for TLF Project-related internships, or for employment with TLF, may include your name, address, or other contact information. In addition, if you choose to provide it, we may collect personal information regarding your membership in a diverse or underrepresented group.\nYour Content . We collect and store the information and content that you post to the Sites, including your questions, answers, comments, forum postings, and responses to surveys. Please see the section on Publicly Available Information for how the information you post will be viewed on our Sites.\nCommunications . When you communicate with us (via email, phone, through the Sites or otherwise), we may maintain a record of your communication.\nPayment Information . To purchase Services (including registering for events, training and certification exams), users may be asked to be directed to a third-party site, such as Stripe, to pay for their purchases. If applicable, the third-party site may collect payment information directly to facilitate a transaction.

We search for simple relations among data, compute, parameters, and performance of large-scale networks. Then we leverage these relations to train networks more efficiently and predictably, and to evaluate our own progress. We’re also investigating what scaling laws for the safety of AI systems might look like, and this will inform our future research.\nSafety and scaling\nAt Anthropic we believe safety research is most useful when performed on highly capable models. Every year, we see larger neural networks which perform better than those that came before. These larger networks also bring new safety challenges. We study and engage with the safety issues of large models so that we can find ways to make them more reliable, share what we learn, and improve safe deployment outcomes across the field. Our immediate focus is prototyping systems that pair these safety techniques with tools for analyzing text and code.\nTools and measurements\nWe believe critically evaluating the potential societal impacts of our work is a key pillar of research. Our approach centers on building tools and measurements to evaluate and understand the capabilities, limitations, and potential for societal impact of our AI systems. A good way to understand our research direction here is to read about some of the work we’ve led or collaborated on in this space: AI and Efficiency , Measurement in AI Policy: Opportunities and Challenges , the AI Index 2021 Annual Report , and Microscope .\nFocused, collaborative research efforts\nWe highly value collaboration on projects, and aim for a mixture of top-down and bottom-up research planning. We always aim to ensure we have a clear, focused research agenda, but we put a lot of emphasis on including everyone — researchers, engineers, societal impact experts and policy analysts — in determining that direction. We look to collaborate with other labs and researchers, as we believe the best research into characterizing these systems will come from a broad community of researchers working together.\nPublications\nNo results found.\nAnthropic Economic Index report: Uneven geographic and enterprise AI adoption\nAnthropic Economic Index: Tracking AI’s role in the US and global economy\nAnthropic Education Report: How educators use Claude\nClaude Opus 4 and 4.1 can now end a rare subset of conversations\nPersona vectors: Monitoring and controlling character traits in language models\nProject Vend: Can Claude run a small shop?

The Interpretability team strives to change that — to understand these models to better plan for a future of safe AI.\nSafety through understanding\nIt's very challenging to reason about the safety of neural networks without understanding them. The Interpretability team’s goal is to be able to explain large language models’ behaviors in detail, and then use that to solve a variety of problems ranging from bias to misuse to autonomous harmful behavior.\nMultidisciplinary approach\nSome Interpretability researchers have deep backgrounds in machine learning – one member of the team is often described as having started mechanistic interpretability, while another was on the famous scaling laws paper. Other members joined after careers in astronomy, physics, mathematics, biology, data visualization, and more.\nJoin the Interpretability team\nResearch Papers\nNo results found.\nPersona vectors: Monitoring and controlling character traits in language models\nOpen-sourcing circuit tracing tools\nTracing the thoughts of a large language model\nAuditing language models for hidden objectives\nInsights on Crosscoder Model Diffing\nEvaluating feature steering: A case study in mitigating social biases\nUsing dictionary learning features as classifiers\nCircuits Updates – September 2024\nCircuits Updates – August 2024\nCircuits Updates – July 2024\nCircuits Updates – June 2024\nThe engineering challenges of scaling interpretability\nMapping the Mind of a Large Language Model\nCircuits Updates – April 2024\nSimple probes can catch sleeper agents\nReflections on Qualitative Research\nDecomposing Language Models Into Understandable Components\nTowards Monosemanticity: Decomposing Language Models With Dictionary Learning\nCircuits Updates — May 2023\nInterpretability Dreams\nDistributed Representations: Composition & Superposition\nPrivileged Bases in the Transformer Residual Stream\nSuperposition, Memorization, and Double Descent\nToy Models of Superposition\nSoftmax Linear Units\nScaling Laws and Interpretability of Learning from Repeated Data\nIn-context Learning and Induction Heads\nA Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits\nAlignment\nFuture AI systems will be even more powerful than today’s, likely in ways that break key assumptions behind current safety techniques — that’s why it’s important to have the right safeguards in place to keep models helpful, honest, and harmless. The Alignment Science team works to understand the challenges ahead and create protocols to train, evaluate, and monitor highly-capable models safely.\nEvaluation and oversight\nAlignment researchers validate that models are harmless and honest even under very different circumstances than those under which they were trained. They also develop methods to allow humans to collaborate with language models to verify claims that humans might not be able to on their own.\nStress-testing safeguards\nAlignment researchers also systematically look for situations in which models might behave badly, and check whether our existing safeguards are sufficient to deal with risks that human-level capabilities may bring.\nJoin the Alignment team\nResearch Papers\nNo results found.\nClaude Opus 4 and 4.1 can now end a rare subset of conversations\nAgentic Misalignment: How LLMs could be insider threats\nSHADE-Arena: Evaluating sabotage and monitoring in LLM agents\nExploring model welfare\nReasoning models don't always say what they think\nAuditing language models for hidden objectives\nForecasting rare language model behaviors\nConstitutional Classifiers: Defending against universal jailbreaks\nAlignment faking in large language models\nSabotage evaluations for frontier models\nSycophancy to subterfuge: Investigating reward tampering in language models\nClaude’s Character\nSimple probes can catch sleeper agents\nMany-shot jailbreaking\nSleeper Agents: Training Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training\nSpecific versus General Principles for Constitutional AI\nTowards Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models\nTracing Model Outputs to the Training Data\nStudying Large Language Model Generalization with Influence Functions\nMeasuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\nQuestion Decomposition Improves the Faithfulness of Model-Generated Reasoning\nDiscovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations\nConstitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback\nMeasuring Progress on Scalable Oversight for Large Language Models\nLanguage Models (Mostly) Know What They Know\nTraining a Helpful and Harmless Assistant with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\nA General Language Assistant as a Laboratory for Alignment\nSocietal Impacts\nFrom examining election integrity risks to studying how AI systems might augment (rather than replace) humans, the Societal Impacts team uses tools from a variety of fields to enable positive relationships between AI and people.\nSociotechnical alignment\nWhich human values should AI models hold, and how should they operate in the face of conflicting or ambiguous values? How is AI used (and misused) in the wild? How can we anticipate future uses and risks of AI? Societal Impacts researchers develop experiments, training methods, and evaluations to answer these questions.\nPolicy relevance\nThough the Societal Impacts team is technical, they often pick research questions that have policy relevance.

We are encouraged by the plan’s focus on accelerating AI infrastructure and federal adoption, as well as strengthening safety testing and security coordination. Many of the plan’s recommendations reflect Anthropic’s response to the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s (OSTP) prior request for information . While the plan positions America for AI advancement, we believe strict export controls and AI development transparency standards remain crucial next steps for securing American AI leadership.\nAccelerating AI infrastructure and adoption\n\nThe Action Plan prioritizes AI infrastructure and adoption, consistent with Anthropic’s submission to OSTP in March.\nWe applaud the Administration's commitment to streamlining data center and energy permitting to address AI’s power needs. As we stated in our OSTP submission and at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit , without adequate domestic energy capacity, American AI developers may be forced to relocate operations overseas, potentially exposing sensitive technology to foreign adversaries. Our recently published “Build AI in America” report details the steps the Administration can take to accelerate the buildout of our nation’s AI infrastructure, and we look forward to working with the Administration on measures to expand domestic energy capacity.\nThe Plan’s recommendations to increase the federal government's adoption of AI also includes proposals that are closely aligned with Anthropic’s policy priorities and recommendations to the White House. These include:\nTasking the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to address resource constraints, procurement limitations, and programmatic obstacles to federal AI adoption.\nLaunching a Request for Information (RFI) to identify federal regulations that impede AI innovation, with OMB coordinating reform efforts.\nUpdating federal procurement standards to remove barriers that prevent agencies from deploying AI systems.\nPromoting AI adoption across defense and national security applications through public-private collaboration.\nDemocratizing AI’s benefits\n\nWe are aligned with the Action Plan’s focus on ensuring broad participation in and benefit from AI’s continued development and deployment.\nThe Action Plan’s continuation of the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot ensures that students and researchers across the country can participate in and contribute to the advancement of the AI frontier. We have long supported the NAIRR and are proud of our partnership with the pilot program. Further, the Action Plan’s emphasis on rapid retraining programs for displaced workers and pre-apprenticeship AI programs recognizes the errors of prior technological transitions and demonstrates a commitment to delivering AI’s benefits to all Americans.\nComplementing these proposals are our efforts to understand how AI is transforming, and how it will transform, our economy. The Economic Index and the Economic Futures Program aim to provide researchers and policymakers with the data and tools they need to ensure AI’s economic benefits are broadly shared and risks are appropriately managed.\nPromoting secure AI development\n\nPowerful AI systems are going to be developed in the coming years. The plan’s emphasis on defending against the misuse of powerful AI models and preparing for future AI related risks is appropriate and excellent. In particular, we commend the administration’s prioritization of supporting research into AI interpretability , AI control systems, and adversarial robustness. These are important lines of research that must be supported to help us deal with powerful AI systems.\nWe're glad the Action Plan affirms the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Center for AI Standards and Innovation’s (CAISI) important work to evaluate frontier models for national security issues and we look forward to continuing our close partnership with them. We encourage the Administration to continue to invest in CAISI. As we noted in our submission, advanced AI systems are demonstrating concerning improvements in capabilities relevant to biological weapons development. CAISI has played a leading role in developing testing and evaluation capabilities to address these risks. We encourage focusing these efforts on the most unique and acute national security risks that AI systems may pose.\nThe need for a national standard\n\nBeyond testing, we believe basic AI development transparency requirements, such as public reporting on safety testing and capability assessments, are essential for responsible AI development. Leading AI model developers should be held to basic and publicly-verifiable standards of assessing and managing the catastrophic risks posed by their systems. Our proposed framework for frontier model transparency focuses on these risks. We would have liked to see the report do more on this topic.\nLeading labs, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind, have already implemented voluntary safety frameworks, which demonstrates that responsible development and innovation can coexist. In fact, with the launch of Claude Opus 4, we proactively activated ASL-3 protections to prevent misuse for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons development. This precautionary step shows that far from slowing innovation, robust safety protections help us build better, more reliable systems.\nWe share the Administration’s concern about overly-prescriptive regulatory approaches creating an inconsistent and burdensome patchwork of laws . Ideally, these transparency requirements would come from the government by way of a single national standard. However, in line with our stated belief that a ten-year moratorium on state AI laws is too blunt an instrument, we continue to oppose proposals aimed at preventing states from enacting measures to protect their citizens from potential harms caused by powerful AI systems, if the federal government fails to act.\nMaintaining strong export controls\n\nThe Action Plan states that “denying our foreign adversaries access to [Advanced AI compute] . . . is a matter of both geostrategic competition and national security.” We strongly agree. That is why we are concerned with the Administration’s recent reversal on export of the Nvidia H20 chips to China.\nAI development has been defined by scaling laws: the intelligence and capability of a system is defined by the scale of its compute, energy, and data inputs during training. While these scaling laws continue to hold, the newest and most capable reasoning models have demonstrated that AI capability scales with the amount of compute made available to a system working on a given task, or “inference.” The amount of compute made available during inference is limited by a chip’s memory bandwidth. While the H20’s raw computing power is exceeded by chips made by Huawei, as Commerce Secretary Lutnick and Under Secretary Kessler recently testified , Huawei continues to struggle with production volume and no domestically-produced Chinese chip matches the H20’s memory bandwidth .\nAs a result, the H20 provides unique and critical computing capabilities that would otherwise be unavailable to Chinese firms, and will compensate for China’s otherwise major shortage of AI chips. To allow export of the H20 to China would squander an opportunity to extend American AI dominance just as a new phase of competition is starting. Moreover, exports of U.S. AI chips will not divert the Chinese Communist Party from its quest for self-reliance in the AI stack .\nTo that end, we strongly encourage the Administration to maintain controls on the H20 chip. These controls are consistent with the export controls recommended by the Action Plan and are essential to securing and growing America’s AI lead.\nLooking ahead\n\nThe alignment between many of our recommendations and the AI Action Plan demonstrates a shared understanding of AI's transformative potential and the urgent actions needed to sustain American leadership.\nWe look forward to working with the Administration to implement these initiatives while ensuring appropriate attention to catastrophic risks and maintaining strong export controls. Together, we can ensure that powerful AI systems are developed safely in America, by American companies, reflecting American values and interests.\nFor more details on our policy recommendations, see our full submission to OSTP , and our ongoing work on responsible AI development and our recent report on increasing domestic energy capacity .\nNews\nHow enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "eadfd90056598043b2f7ed8ade57e0be098c7df25885fffd59ba57c6486dda01", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 2222, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 19647, "ratings": []}

It's the strongest model for building complex agents. It’s the best model at using computers. And it shows substantial gains in reasoning and math.\n\nCode is everywhere. It runs every application, spreadsheet, and software tool you use. Being able to use those tools and reason through hard problems is how modern work gets done.\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 makes this possible. We're releasing it along with a set of major upgrades to our products. In Claude Code , we've added checkpoints—one of our most requested features—that save your progress and allow you to roll back instantly to a previous state. We've refreshed the terminal interface and shipped a native VS Code extension . We've added a new context editing feature and memory tool to the Claude API that lets agents run even longer and handle even greater complexity. In the Claude apps , we've brought code execution and file creation (spreadsheets, slides, and documents) directly into the conversation. And we've made the Claude for Chrome extension available to Max users who joined the waitlist last month.\n\nWe're also giving developers the building blocks we use ourselves to make Claude Code. We're calling this the Claude Agent SDK . The infrastructure that powers our frontier products—and allows them to reach their full potential—is now yours to build with.\n\nThis is the most aligned frontier model we’ve ever released, showing large improvements across several areas of alignment compared to previous Claude models.\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 is available everywhere today. If you’re a developer, simply use claude-sonnet-4-5 via the Claude API . Pricing remains the same as Claude Sonnet 4, at $3/$15 per million tokens.\n\nFrontier intelligence\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 is state-of-the-art on the SWE-bench Verified evaluation, which measures real-world software coding abilities. Practically speaking, we’ve observed it maintaining focus for more than 30 hours on complex, multi-step tasks.\n\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 represents a significant leap forward on computer use. On OSWorld, a benchmark that tests AI models on real-world computer tasks, Sonnet 4.5 now leads at 61.4%. Just four months ago, Sonnet 4 held the lead at 42.2%. Our Claude for Chrome extension puts these upgraded capabilities to use. In the demo below, we show Claude working directly in a browser, navigating sites, filling spreadsheets, and completing tasks.\n\n\nThe model also shows improved capabilities on a broad range of evaluations including reasoning and math:\nExperts in finance, law, medicine, and STEM found Sonnet 4.5 shows dramatically better domain-specific knowledge and reasoning compared to older models, including Opus 4.1.\nThe model’s capabilities are also reflected in the experiences of early customers:\nOur most aligned model yet\nAs well as being our most capable model, Claude Sonnet 4.5 is our most aligned frontier model yet. Claude’s improved capabilities and our extensive safety training have allowed us to substantially improve the model’s behavior, reducing concerning behaviors like sycophancy, deception, power-seeking, and the tendency to encourage delusional thinking. For the model’s agentic and computer use capabilities, we’ve also made considerable progress on defending against prompt injection attacks, one of the most serious risks for users of these capabilities.\nYou can read a detailed set of safety and alignment evaluations, which for the first time includes tests using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, in the Claude Sonnet 4.5 system card .\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 is being released under our AI Safety Level 3 (ASL-3) protections, as per our framework that matches model capabilities with appropriate safeguards. These safeguards include filters called classifiers that aim to detect potentially dangerous inputs and outputs—in particular those related to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons.\nThese classifiers might sometimes inadvertently flag normal content. We’ve made it easy for users to continue any interrupted conversations with Sonnet 4, a model that poses a lower CBRN risk. We've already made significant progress in reducing these false positives, reducing them by a factor of ten since we originally described them , and a factor of two since Claude Opus 4 was released in May. We’re continuing to make progress in making the classifiers more discerning 1 .\n\nThe Claude Agent SDK\nWe've spent more than six months shipping updates to Claude Code, so we know what it takes to build and design AI agents. We've solved hard problems: how agents should manage memory across long-running tasks, how to handle permission systems that balance autonomy with user control, and how to coordinate subagents working toward a shared goal.\nNow we’re making all of this available to you. The Claude Agent SDK is the same infrastructure that powers Claude Code, but it shows impressive benefits for a very wide variety of tasks, not just coding. As of today, you can use it to build your own agents.\n\nWe built Claude Code because the tool we wanted didn’t exist yet. The Agent SDK gives you the same foundation to build something just as capable for whatever problem you're solving.\n\nBonus research preview\nWe’re releasing a temporary research preview alongside Claude Sonnet 4.5, called \" Imagine with Claude \".\n\nIn this experiment, Claude generates software on the fly. No functionality is predetermined; no code is prewritten. What you see is Claude creating in real time, responding and adapting to your requests as you interact.\n\nIt's a fun demonstration showing what Claude Sonnet 4.5 can do—a way to see what's possible when you combine a capable model with the right infrastructure.\n\n\"Imagine with Claude\" is available to Max subscribers for the next five days. We encourage you to try it out on claude.ai/imagine .\n\nFurther information\nWe recommend upgrading to Claude Sonnet 4.5 for all uses. Whether you’re using Claude through our apps, our API, or Claude Code, Sonnet 4.5 is a drop-in replacement that provides much improved performance for the same price. Claude Code updates are available to all users. Claude Developer Platform updates, including the Claude Agent SDK, are available to all developers. Code execution and file creation are available on all paid plans in the Claude apps.\n\nFor complete technical details and evaluation results, see our system card , model page , and documentation .

Methodology\nSWE-bench Verified : All Claude results were reported using a simple scaffold with two tools—bash and file editing via string replacements. We report 77.2%, which was averaged over 10 trials, no test-time compute, and 200K thinking budget on the full 500-problem SWE-bench Verified dataset. The score reported uses a minor prompt addition: \"You should use tools as much as possible, ideally more than 100 times. You should also implement your own tests first before attempting the problem.\" A 1M context configuration achieves 78.2%, but we report the 200K result as our primary score as the 1M configuration was implicated in our recent inference issues . For our \"high compute\" numbers we adopt additional complexity and parallel test-time compute as follows: We sample multiple parallel attempts. We discard patches that break the visible regression tests in the repository, similar to the rejection sampling approach adopted by Agentless (Xia et al. 2024); note no hidden test information is used. We then use an internal scoring model to select the best candidate from the remaining attempts. This results in a score of 82.0% for Sonnet 4.5.\nThe score reported uses a minor prompt addition: \"You should use tools as much as possible, ideally more than 100 times.

This financing demonstrates investors’ extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth.”\n\nAnthropic has seen rapid growth since the launch of Claude in March 2023. At the beginning of 2025, less than two years after launch, Anthropic’s run-rate revenue had grown to approximately $1 billion. By August 2025, just eight months later, our run-rate revenue reached over $5 billion—making Anthropic one of the fastest-growing technology companies in history.\n\nAnthropic’s trajectory has been driven by our leading technical talent, our focus on safety, and our frontier research, including pioneering alignment and interpretability work, all of which underpin the performance and reliability of our models. Every day more businesses, developers, and consumer power users are trusting Claude to help them solve their most challenging problems. Anthropic now serves over 300,000 business customers, and our number of large accounts—customers that each represent over $100,000 in run-rate revenue—has grown nearly 7x in the past year.\n\nThis growth spans the entire Anthropic platform, with advancements for businesses, developers, and consumers. For businesses, our API and industry-specific products make it easy to add powerful AI to their critical applications without complex integration work. Developers have made Claude Code their tool of choice since its full launch in May 2025. Claude Code has quickly taken off—already generating over $500 million in run-rate revenue with usage growing more than 10x in just three months. For individual users, the Pro and Max plans for Claude deliver enhanced AI capabilities for everyday tasks and specialized projects.\n\n“Anthropic is on an exceptional trajectory, combining research excellence, technological leadership, and relentless focus on customers. We’re honored to partner with Dario and the team, and our lead investment in their Series F reflects our belief in their values and their ability to shape the future of responsible AI,” said Divesh Makan, Partner at ICONIQ. “Enterprise leaders tell us what we’re seeing firsthand—Claude is reliable, built on a trustworthy foundation, and guided by leaders truly focused on the long term.”\n\nThe Series F investment will expand our capacity to meet growing enterprise demand, deepen our safety research, and support international expansion as we continue building reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.\nNews\nHow enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "4d4cc8e6c47fcb58922ce89a51af8422e0ac85ff887260dec4e612b27b3dd846", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 976, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 10238, "ratings": []}

We search for simple relations among data, compute, parameters, and performance of large-scale networks. Then we leverage these relations to train networks more efficiently and predictably, and to evaluate our own progress. We’re also investigating what scaling laws for the safety of AI systems might look like, and this will inform our future research.\nSafety and scaling\nAt Anthropic we believe safety research is most useful when performed on highly capable models. Every year, we see larger neural networks which perform better than those that came before. These larger networks also bring new safety challenges. We study and engage with the safety issues of large models so that we can find ways to make them more reliable, share what we learn, and improve safe deployment outcomes across the field. Our immediate focus is prototyping systems that pair these safety techniques with tools for analyzing text and code.\nTools and measurements\nWe believe critically evaluating the potential societal impacts of our work is a key pillar of research. Our approach centers on building tools and measurements to evaluate and understand the capabilities, limitations, and potential for societal impact of our AI systems. A good way to understand our research direction here is to read about some of the work we’ve led or collaborated on in this space: AI and Efficiency , Measurement in AI Policy: Opportunities and Challenges , the AI Index 2021 Annual Report , and Microscope .\nFocused, collaborative research efforts\nWe highly value collaboration on projects, and aim for a mixture of top-down and bottom-up research planning. We always aim to ensure we have a clear, focused research agenda, but we put a lot of emphasis on including everyone — researchers, engineers, societal impact experts and policy analysts — in determining that direction. We look to collaborate with other labs and researchers, as we believe the best research into characterizing these systems will come from a broad community of researchers working together.\nPublications\nNo results found.\nAnthropic Economic Index report: Uneven geographic and enterprise AI adoption\nAnthropic Economic Index: Tracking AI’s role in the US and global economy\nAnthropic Education Report: How educators use Claude\nClaude Opus 4 and 4.1 can now end a rare subset of conversations\nPersona vectors: Monitoring and controlling character traits in language models\nProject Vend: Can Claude run a small shop?

The Interpretability team’s goal is to be able to explain large language models’ behaviors in detail, and then use that to solve a variety of problems ranging from bias to misuse to autonomous harmful behavior.\nMultidisciplinary approach\nSome Interpretability researchers have deep backgrounds in machine learning – one member of the team is often described as having started mechanistic interpretability, while another was on the famous scaling laws paper.

The Alignment Science team works to understand the challenges ahead and create protocols to train, evaluate, and monitor highly-capable models safely.\nEvaluation and oversight\nAlignment researchers validate that models are harmless and honest even under very different circumstances than those under which they were trained. They also develop methods to allow humans to collaborate with language models to verify claims that humans might not be able to on their own.\nStress-testing safeguards\nAlignment researchers also systematically look for situations in which models might behave badly, and check whether our existing safeguards are sufficient to deal with risks that human-level capabilities may bring.\nJoin the Alignment team\nResearch Papers\nNo results found.\nClaude Opus 4 and 4.1 can now end a rare subset of conversations\nAgentic Misalignment: How LLMs could be insider threats\nSHADE-Arena: Evaluating sabotage and monitoring in LLM agents\nExploring model welfare\nReasoning models don't always say what they think\nAuditing language models for hidden objectives\nForecasting rare language model behaviors\nConstitutional Classifiers: Defending against universal jailbreaks\nAlignment faking in large language models\nSabotage evaluations for frontier models\nSycophancy to subterfuge: Investigating reward tampering in language models\nClaude’s Character\nSimple probes can catch sleeper agents\nMany-shot jailbreaking\nSleeper Agents: Training Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training\nSpecific versus General Principles for Constitutional AI\nTowards Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models\nTracing Model Outputs to the Training Data\nStudying Large Language Model Generalization with Influence Functions\nMeasuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\nQuestion Decomposition Improves the Faithfulness of Model-Generated Reasoning\nDiscovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations\nConstitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback\nMeasuring Progress on Scalable Oversight for Large Language Models\nLanguage Models (Mostly) Know What They Know\nTraining a Helpful and Harmless Assistant with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\nA General Language Assistant as a Laboratory for Alignment\nSocietal Impacts\nFrom examining election integrity risks to studying how AI systems might augment (rather than replace) humans, the Societal Impacts team uses tools from a variety of fields to enable positive relationships between AI and people.\nSociotechnical alignment\nWhich human values should AI models hold, and how should they operate in the face of conflicting or ambiguous values? How is AI used (and misused) in the wild? How can we anticipate future uses and risks of AI? Societal Impacts researchers develop experiments, training methods, and evaluations to answer these questions.\nPolicy relevance\nThough the Societal Impacts team is technical, they often pick research questions that have policy relevance.

They also develop methods to allow humans to collaborate with language models to verify claims that humans might not be able to on their own.\nStress-testing safeguards\nAlignment researchers also systematically look for situations in which models might behave badly, and check whether our existing safeguards are sufficient to deal with risks that human-level capabilities may bring.\nJoin the Alignment team\nResearch Papers\nNo results found.\nClaude Opus 4 and 4.1 can now end a rare subset of conversations\nAgentic Misalignment: How LLMs could be insider threats\nSHADE-Arena: Evaluating sabotage and monitoring in LLM agents\nExploring model welfare\nReasoning models don't always say what they think\nAuditing language models for hidden objectives\nForecasting rare language model behaviors\nConstitutional Classifiers: Defending against universal jailbreaks\nAlignment faking in large language models\nSabotage evaluations for frontier models\nSycophancy to subterfuge: Investigating reward tampering in language models\nClaude’s Character\nSimple probes can catch sleeper agents\nMany-shot jailbreaking\nSleeper Agents: Training Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training\nSpecific versus General Principles for Constitutional AI\nTowards Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models\nTracing Model Outputs to the Training Data\nStudying Large Language Model Generalization with Influence Functions\nMeasuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\nQuestion Decomposition Improves the Faithfulness of Model-Generated Reasoning\nDiscovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations\nConstitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback\nMeasuring Progress on Scalable Oversight for Large Language Models\nLanguage Models (Mostly) Know What They Know\nTraining a Helpful and Harmless Assistant with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\nA General Language Assistant as a Laboratory for Alignment\nSocietal Impacts\nFrom examining election integrity risks to studying how AI systems might augment (rather than replace) humans, the Societal Impacts team uses tools from a variety of fields to enable positive relationships between AI and people.\nSociotechnical alignment\nWhich human values should AI models hold, and how should they operate in the face of conflicting or ambiguous values?

We are encouraged by the plan’s focus on accelerating AI infrastructure and federal adoption, as well as strengthening safety testing and security coordination. Many of the plan’s recommendations reflect Anthropic’s response to the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s (OSTP) prior request for information . While the plan positions America for AI advancement, we believe strict export controls and AI development transparency standards remain crucial next steps for securing American AI leadership.\nAccelerating AI infrastructure and adoption\n\nThe Action Plan prioritizes AI infrastructure and adoption, consistent with Anthropic’s submission to OSTP in March.\nWe applaud the Administration's commitment to streamlining data center and energy permitting to address AI’s power needs. As we stated in our OSTP submission and at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit , without adequate domestic energy capacity, American AI developers may be forced to relocate operations overseas, potentially exposing sensitive technology to foreign adversaries. Our recently published “Build AI in America” report details the steps the Administration can take to accelerate the buildout of our nation’s AI infrastructure, and we look forward to working with the Administration on measures to expand domestic energy capacity.\nThe Plan’s recommendations to increase the federal government's adoption of AI also includes proposals that are closely aligned with Anthropic’s policy priorities and recommendations to the White House. These include:\nTasking the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to address resource constraints, procurement limitations, and programmatic obstacles to federal AI adoption.\nLaunching a Request for Information (RFI) to identify federal regulations that impede AI innovation, with OMB coordinating reform efforts.\nUpdating federal procurement standards to remove barriers that prevent agencies from deploying AI systems.\nPromoting AI adoption across defense and national security applications through public-private collaboration.\nDemocratizing AI’s benefits\n\nWe are aligned with the Action Plan’s focus on ensuring broad participation in and benefit from AI’s continued development and deployment.\nThe Action Plan’s continuation of the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot ensures that students and researchers across the country can participate in and contribute to the advancement of the AI frontier. We have long supported the NAIRR and are proud of our partnership with the pilot program. Further, the Action Plan’s emphasis on rapid retraining programs for displaced workers and pre-apprenticeship AI programs recognizes the errors of prior technological transitions and demonstrates a commitment to delivering AI’s benefits to all Americans.\nComplementing these proposals are our efforts to understand how AI is transforming, and how it will transform, our economy. The Economic Index and the Economic Futures Program aim to provide researchers and policymakers with the data and tools they need to ensure AI’s economic benefits are broadly shared and risks are appropriately managed.\nPromoting secure AI development\n\nPowerful AI systems are going to be developed in the coming years. The plan’s emphasis on defending against the misuse of powerful AI models and preparing for future AI related risks is appropriate and excellent. In particular, we commend the administration’s prioritization of supporting research into AI interpretability , AI control systems, and adversarial robustness. These are important lines of research that must be supported to help us deal with powerful AI systems.\nWe're glad the Action Plan affirms the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Center for AI Standards and Innovation’s (CAISI) important work to evaluate frontier models for national security issues and we look forward to continuing our close partnership with them. We encourage the Administration to continue to invest in CAISI. As we noted in our submission, advanced AI systems are demonstrating concerning improvements in capabilities relevant to biological weapons development. CAISI has played a leading role in developing testing and evaluation capabilities to address these risks. We encourage focusing these efforts on the most unique and acute national security risks that AI systems may pose.\nThe need for a national standard\n\nBeyond testing, we believe basic AI development transparency requirements, such as public reporting on safety testing and capability assessments, are essential for responsible AI development. Leading AI model developers should be held to basic and publicly-verifiable standards of assessing and managing the catastrophic risks posed by their systems. Our proposed framework for frontier model transparency focuses on these risks. We would have liked to see the report do more on this topic.\nLeading labs, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind, have already implemented voluntary safety frameworks, which demonstrates that responsible development and innovation can coexist. In fact, with the launch of Claude Opus 4, we proactively activated ASL-3 protections to prevent misuse for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons development. This precautionary step shows that far from slowing innovation, robust safety protections help us build better, more reliable systems.\nWe share the Administration’s concern about overly-prescriptive regulatory approaches creating an inconsistent and burdensome patchwork of laws . Ideally, these transparency requirements would come from the government by way of a single national standard. However, in line with our stated belief that a ten-year moratorium on state AI laws is too blunt an instrument, we continue to oppose proposals aimed at preventing states from enacting measures to protect their citizens from potential harms caused by powerful AI systems, if the federal government fails to act.\nMaintaining strong export controls\n\nThe Action Plan states that “denying our foreign adversaries access to [Advanced AI compute] . . . is a matter of both geostrategic competition and national security.” We strongly agree. That is why we are concerned with the Administration’s recent reversal on export of the Nvidia H20 chips to China.\nAI development has been defined by scaling laws: the intelligence and capability of a system is defined by the scale of its compute, energy, and data inputs during training. While these scaling laws continue to hold, the newest and most capable reasoning models have demonstrated that AI capability scales with the amount of compute made available to a system working on a given task, or “inference.” The amount of compute made available during inference is limited by a chip’s memory bandwidth. While the H20’s raw computing power is exceeded by chips made by Huawei, as Commerce Secretary Lutnick and Under Secretary Kessler recently testified , Huawei continues to struggle with production volume and no domestically-produced Chinese chip matches the H20’s memory bandwidth .\nAs a result, the H20 provides unique and critical computing capabilities that would otherwise be unavailable to Chinese firms, and will compensate for China’s otherwise major shortage of AI chips. To allow export of the H20 to China would squander an opportunity to extend American AI dominance just as a new phase of competition is starting. Moreover, exports of U.S. AI chips will not divert the Chinese Communist Party from its quest for self-reliance in the AI stack .\nTo that end, we strongly encourage the Administration to maintain controls on the H20 chip. These controls are consistent with the export controls recommended by the Action Plan and are essential to securing and growing America’s AI lead.\nLooking ahead\n\nThe alignment between many of our recommendations and the AI Action Plan demonstrates a shared understanding of AI's transformative potential and the urgent actions needed to sustain American leadership.\nWe look forward to working with the Administration to implement these initiatives while ensuring appropriate attention to catastrophic risks and maintaining strong export controls. Together, we can ensure that powerful AI systems are developed safely in America, by American companies, reflecting American values and interests.\nFor more details on our policy recommendations, see our full submission to OSTP , and our ongoing work on responsible AI development and our recent report on increasing domestic energy capacity .\nNews\nHow enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "eadfd90056598043b2f7ed8ade57e0be098c7df25885fffd59ba57c6486dda01", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 2222, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 19697, "ratings": []}
