The LTBT is our attempt to fine-tune our corporate governance to address the unique challenges and long-term opportunities we believe transformative AI will present .\nThe Trust is an independent body of five financially disinterested members with an authority to select and remove a portion of our Board that will grow over time (ultimately, a majority of our Board). Paired with our Public Benefit Corporation status, the LTBT helps to align our corporate governance with our mission of developing and maintaining advanced AI for the long-term benefit of humanity.\nCorporate Governance Basics A corporation is overseen by its board of directors. The board selects and oversees the leadership team (especially the CEO), who in turn hire and manage the employees. The default corporate governance setup makes directors accountable to the stockholders in several ways. For example:\nDirectors are elected by, and may be removed by stockholders.\nDirectors are legally accountable to stockholders for fulfilling their fiduciary duties.\nDirectors are often paid in shares of stock of the corporation, which helps to align their incentives with the financial interests of stockholders.\nImportantly, the rights to elect, remove, and sue directors belong exclusively to the stockholders. Some wonder, therefore, whether directors of a corporation are permitted to optimize for stakeholders beyond the corporation’s stockholders, such as customers and the general public. This question is the subject of a rich debate, which we won’t delve into here. For present purposes, it is enough to observe that all the key mechanisms of accountability in corporate law push directors to prioritize the financial interests of stockholders. Fine-tuning Anthropic’s Corporate Governance Corporate governance has seen centuries of legal precedent and iteration, and views differ greatly on its effectiveness, strengths, and weaknesses. At Anthropic, our perspective is that the capacity of corporate governance to produce socially beneficial outcomes depends strongly on non-market externalities. Externalities are a type of market failure that occurs when a transaction between two parties imposes costs or benefits on a third party who has not consented to the transaction. Common examples of costs include pollution from factories, systemic financial risk from banks, and national security risks from weapons manufacturers. Examples of positive spillover effects include the societal benefits of education that reach beyond the individuals being educated, or investments in R&D that boost entire sectors beyond the company making the investment. Many parties who contract with a corporation, such as customers, workers, and suppliers, are capable of negotiating or demanding prices and terms that reflect the full costs and benefits of their exchanges. But other parties, such as the general public, don’t directly contract with a corporation and therefore do not have a means to charge or pay for the costs and benefits they experience. The greater the externalities, the less we expect corporate governance defaults to serve the interests of non-contracting parties such as the general public. We believe AI may create unprecedentedly large externalities , ranging from national security risks, to large-scale economic disruption, to fundamental threats to humanity, to enormous benefits to human safety and health. The technology is advancing so rapidly that the laws and social norms that constrain other high-externality corporate activities have yet to catch up with AI; this has led us to invest in fine-tuning Anthropic’s governance to meet the challenge ahead of us. To be clear, for most of the day-to-day decisions Anthropic makes, public benefit is not at odds with commercial success or stockholder returns, and if anything our experience has shown that the two are often strongly synergistic: our ability to do effective safety research depends on building frontier models (the resources for which are greatly aided by commercial success), and our ability to foster a “race to the top” depends on being a viable company in the ecosystem in both a technical sense and a commercial sense. We do not expect the LTBT to intervene in these day-to-day decisions or in our ordinary commercial strategy. Rather, the need for fine-tuning of the governance structure ultimately derives from the potential for extreme events and the need to handle them with humanity’s interests in mind, and we expect the LTBT to primarily concern itself with these long-range issues. For example, the LTBT can ensure that the organizational leadership is incentivized to carefully evaluate future models for catastrophic risks or ensure they have nation-state level security, rather than prioritizing being the first to market above all other objectives. Baseline: Public Benefit Corporation One governance feature we have already shared is that Anthropic is a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation, or PBC. Like most large companies in the United States, Anthropic is incorporated in Delaware, and Delaware corporate law expressly permits the directors of a PBC to balance the financial interests of the stockholders with the public benefit purpose specified in the corporation’s certificate of incorporation, and the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation’s conduct. The public benefit purpose stated in Anthropic’s certificate is the responsible development and maintenance of advanced AI for the long-term benefit of humanity. This gives our board the legal latitude to weigh long- and short-term externalities of decisions–whether to deploy a particular AI system, for example–alongside the financial interests of our stockholders. The legal latitude afforded by our PBC structure is important in aligning Anthropic’s governance with our public benefit mission. But we didn’t feel it was enough for the governance challenges we foresee in the development of transformative AI. Although the PBC form makes it legally permissible for directors to balance public interests with the maximization of stockholder value, it does not make the directors of the corporation directly accountable to other stakeholders or align their incentives with the interests of the general public. We set out to design a structure that would supply our directors with the requisite accountability and incentives to appropriately balance the financial interests of our stockholders and our public benefit purpose at key junctures where we expect the consequences of our decisions to reach far beyond Anthropic. LTBT: Basic Structure and Features The Anthropic Long-Term Benefit Trust (LTBT, or Trust) is an independent body comprising five Trustees with backgrounds and expertise in AI safety, national security, public policy, and social enterprise. The Trust’s arrangements are designed to insulate the Trustees from financial interest in Anthropic and to grant them sufficient independence to balance the interests of the public alongside the interests of Anthropic’s stockholders. At the close of our Series C , we amended our corporate charter to create a new class of stock (Class T) held exclusively by the Trust.1 The Class T stock grants the Trust the authority to elect and remove a number of Anthropic’s board members that will phase in according to time- and funding-based milestones; in any event, the Trust will elect a majority of the board within 4 years. At the same time, we created a new director seat that will be elected by the Series C and subsequent investors to ensure that our investors’ perspectives will be directly represented on the board into the future. The Class T stock also includes “protective provisions” that require the Trust to receive notice of certain actions that could significantly alter the corporation or its business. The Trust is organized as a “purpose trust” under the common law of Delaware, with a purpose that is the same as that of Anthropic. The Trust must use its powers to ensure that Anthropic responsibly balances the financial interests of stockholders with the interests of those affected by Anthropic’s conduct and our public benefit purpose. A Different Kind of Stockholder In establishing the Long-Term Benefit Trust we have, in effect, created a different kind of stockholder in Anthropic. Anthropic will continue to be overseen by its board, which we expect will make the decisions of consequence on the path to transformative AI. In navigating these decisions, a majority of the board will ultimately have accountability to the Trust as well as to stockholders, and will thus have incentives to appropriately balance the public benefit with stockholder interests. Moreover, the board will benefit from the insights of Trustees with deep expertise and experience in areas key to Anthropic’s public benefit mission. Together we believe the insights and incentives supplied by the Trust will result in better decision making when the stakes are highest. The gradual “phase-in” of the LTBT will allow us to course-correct an experimental structure and also reflects a hypothesis that, early in a company’s history, it can often function best with streamlined governance and not too many stakeholders; whereas as it becomes more mature and has more profound effects on society, externalities tend to manifest themselves progressively more, making checks and balances more critical. A Corporate Governance Experiment The Long-Term Benefit Trust is an experiment. Its design is a considered hypothesis, informed by some of the most accomplished corporate governance scholars and practitioners in the nation, who helped our leadership design and “red team” this structure. We’re not yet ready to hold this out as an example to emulate; we are empiricists and want to see how it works. One of the most difficult design challenges was reconciling the imperative for the Trust structure to be resilient to end runs while the stakes are high with the reality of the Trust’s experimental nature. It’s important to prevent this arrangement from being easily undone, but it is also rare to get something like this right on the first try. We have therefore designed a process for amendment that carefully balances durability with flexibility. We envision that most adjustments will be made by agreement of the Trustees and Anthropic’s Board, or the Trustees and the other stockholders. Owing to the Trust’s experimental nature, however, we have also designed a series of “failsafe” provisions that allow changes to the Trust and its powers without the consent of the Trustees if sufficiently large supermajorities of the stockholders agree. The required supermajorities increase as the Trust’s power phases in, on the theory that we’ll have more experience–and less need for iteration–as time goes on, and the stakes will become higher. Meet the Initial Trustees The initial Trustees are: Jason Matheny : CEO of the RAND Corporation Kanika Bahl : CEO & President of Evidence Action Neil Buddy Shah : CEO of the Clinton Health Access Initiative (Chair) Paul Christiano : Founder of the Alignment Research Center Zach Robinson : Interim CEO of Effective Ventures US The Anthropic board chose these initial Trustees after a year-long search and interview process to surface individuals who exhibit thoughtfulness, strong character, and a deep understanding of the risks, benefits, and trajectory of AI and its impacts on society. Trustees serve one-year terms and future Trustees will be elected by a vote of the Trustees. We are honored that this founding group of Trustees chose to accept their places on the Trust, and we believe they will provide invaluable insight and judgment.\n\n\n[1] An earlier version of the Trust, which was then called the “Long-Term Benefit Committee,” was written into our Series A investment documents in 2021, but since the committee was not slated to elect its first director until 2023, we took the intervening time to red-team and improve the legal structure and to carefully consider candidate selection. The current LTBT is the result.\n[2] The Trust structure was designed and “red teamed” with immeasurable assistance by John Morley of Yale Law School , David Berger , Amy Simmerman , and other lawyers from Wilson Sonsini, and by Noah Feldman and Seth Berman from Harvard Law School and Ethical Compass Advisors .\nFootnotes\nIn December 2023, Jason Matheny stepped down from the Trust to preempt any potential conflicts of interest that might arise with RAND Corporation's policy-related initiatives. Paul Christiano stepped down in April 2024 to take a new role as the Head of AI Safety at the U.S. AI Safety Institute . Their replacements will be elected by the Trustees in due course.\nNews\nHow enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "2f45ac6453f9e2f9c4b7b6830d703237abe1a1d8aa88e2c2d8cad02b85abcc26", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 3279, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 28149, "ratings": []}

New developers took months to understand and contribute to complex codebases. As a cybersecurity leader, they needed an AI solution that prioritized safety and security while accelerating their global engineering organization.\nAfter evaluating multiple providers, they chose Claude on Google Cloud's Vertex AI for its coding performance, security standards, and seamless integration. The results: a 20-30% increase in feature development velocity and dramatically reduced onboarding time—from months to weeks. They've onboarded 2,500 developers to work with Claude, with plans to reach 3,500. Junior developers with no prior knowledge of complex products completed integration tasks 70% faster with Claude's assistance. The company is now pioneering an AI post-processing system in CI/CD that automatically improves variable names, adds comments, and generates unit tests.\n\"Anthropic prioritized safety and security a lot more than other LLMs,\" said Gunjan Patel, Director of Engineering at Palo Alto Networks. \"They discuss security implications in every meeting. As the largest cybersecurity company, that's a big deal for us.\"\nSalesforce powers autonomous AI agents\nEnterprises increasingly need AI systems that can do more than assist—they need autonomous agents that can reason through complex business scenarios, make decisions, and take action across systems without constant human intervention.\nSalesforce integrated Claude models to power Agentforce Agents through Einstein 1 Studio, creating a platform where AI can plan and execute on behalf of employees and customers. All interactions with Claude flow through Salesforce's secure AI systems, with safeguards like dynamic grounding and toxicity detection through the Einstein Trust Layer ensuring responsible AI use even in highly regulated industries.\nSalesforce customers are now deploying autonomous agents that orchestrate complete workflows end-to-end: analyzing customer data to identify opportunities, executing transactions, and updating records across multiple platforms—all without human intervention.\nThis also represents a fundamental shift from AI-as-assistant to AI-as-autonomous-collaborator. Developers can customize agents for industry-specific use cases across sales, marketing, and customer service, with the flexibility to choose Claude models that balance intelligence, speed, and cost for each specific workflow.\n\"Through our partnership with Anthropic, customers gain the flexibility to integrate their own LLMs, introducing Claude models with diverse levels of intelligence, speed, and cost-effectiveness,\" said Kaushal Kurapati, Senior Vice President of Product for AI at Salesforce. \"This empowers users to tailor their CRM applications to their unique requirements.\"\nHow IG Group accelerates marketing, analytics, and global operations\nWhen IG Group , a global leader in online trading, tested multiple AI providers, Claude consistently outperformed competitors across their most demanding use cases. The Data and AI transformation team deployed Claude strategically: automating complex analytics workflows, helping HR managers generate consistent performance feedback across regions, and enabling marketing teams to produce multilingual content while navigating strict regulatory requirements.\nThe results exceeded expectations. Analytics teams now save 70 hours weekly , redirecting that capacity toward higher-value strategic work. In certain use cases, productivity doubled .

The companies seeing real impact share a few characteristics:\nThey start with concrete business problems. Rather than deploying AI for its own sake, they target specific bottlenecks—analyst workflows that consume hours of manual work, documentation backlogs that slow product launches, or onboarding processes that take months instead of weeks.\nThey invest in people, not just technology. Comprehensive training programs and champion networks help employees integrate AI into their daily work. When teams understand not just how to use AI but why it matters to their specific role, adoption accelerates organically. Learn more about how enterprises are using AI and its impact on their work in our Economic Index .\nThey measure what matters. Tracking concrete metrics—productivity gains, time savings, quality improvements—turns impressive demos into defensible business cases. This evidence-based approach ensures continuous refinement and proves ROI to stakeholders.\nThey build for scale from day one. Integration, security, compliance, and trust aren't afterthoughts. Treating AI as an enterprise transformation rather than a technology experiment leads to faster adoption and more sustainable outcomes.\nOrganizations like Novo Nordisk, IG Group, Palo Alto Networks, Cox Automotive, and Salesforce are pioneering this approach with Claude, expanding use cases across teams, building agentic systems that reshape workflows, and delivering true AI transformation.\nResearch-driven reliability at enterprise scale\nThis enterprise transformation is made possible by Anthropic's foundational research in AI safety, interpretability, and alignment. Our work in mechanistic interpretability —understanding how AI systems reason and make decisions—enables us to build models that are not just powerful, but predictable and auditable. Through alignment research , we've developed techniques that make Claude inherently steerable, allowing organizations to align AI behavior with their specific values and requirements without extensive fine-tuning. For enterprises deploying autonomous agents in regulated industries or mission-critical operations, this research translates directly into operational confidence.\nThe result is an AI partner that enterprises can trust with increasingly autonomous responsibilities, knowing that the same research rigor underlying Claude's capabilities also ensures its safety and controllability at scale.\nGetting started on your enterprise AI journey\nWhether you're just beginning to explore AI or already deploying agents at scale, Anthropic provides the resources to help you succeed:\nHow Anthropic teams use Claude Code: Learn how our own teams leverage AI to accelerate development, with practical examples and implementation strategies.\nCustomer case studies : More stories of how organizations across financial services, healthcare, cybersecurity, and other industries are driving transformation with Claude.\nAnthropic Academy : Access our AI Fluency and Building Agents courses to develop the skills your team needs to work effectively with AI.\nContact our Sales team to learn more.\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025\nNews\nIntroducing Claude Sonnet 4.5\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "479e67dd605bc83aab2c258a5bad4a3852357a7fa2fb07a4e057a158b5769b69", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 2803, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 24364, "ratings": []}

Learn more about how enterprises are using AI and its impact on their work in our Economic Index .\nThey measure what matters. Tracking concrete metrics—productivity gains, time savings, quality improvements—turns impressive demos into defensible business cases. This evidence-based approach ensures continuous refinement and proves ROI to stakeholders.\nThey build for scale from day one. Integration, security, compliance, and trust aren't afterthoughts. Treating AI as an enterprise transformation rather than a technology experiment leads to faster adoption and more sustainable outcomes.\nOrganizations like Novo Nordisk, IG Group, Palo Alto Networks, Cox Automotive, and Salesforce are pioneering this approach with Claude, expanding use cases across teams, building agentic systems that reshape workflows, and delivering true AI transformation.\nResearch-driven reliability at enterprise scale\nThis enterprise transformation is made possible by Anthropic's foundational research in AI safety, interpretability, and alignment. Our work in mechanistic interpretability —understanding how AI systems reason and make decisions—enables us to build models that are not just powerful, but predictable and auditable. Through alignment research , we've developed techniques that make Claude inherently steerable, allowing organizations to align AI behavior with their specific values and requirements without extensive fine-tuning. For enterprises deploying autonomous agents in regulated industries or mission-critical operations, this research translates directly into operational confidence.\nThe result is an AI partner that enterprises can trust with increasingly autonomous responsibilities, knowing that the same research rigor underlying Claude's capabilities also ensures its safety and controllability at scale.\nGetting started on your enterprise AI journey\nWhether you're just beginning to explore AI or already deploying agents at scale, Anthropic provides the resources to help you succeed:\nHow Anthropic teams use Claude Code: Learn how our own teams leverage AI to accelerate development, with practical examples and implementation strategies.\nCustomer case studies : More stories of how organizations across financial services, healthcare, cybersecurity, and other industries are driving transformation with Claude.\nAnthropic Academy : Access our AI Fluency and Building Agents courses to develop the skills your team needs to work effectively with AI.\nContact our Sales team to learn more.\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025\nNews\nIntroducing Claude Sonnet 4.5\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "479e67dd605bc83aab2c258a5bad4a3852357a7fa2fb07a4e057a158b5769b69", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 2803, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 24358, "ratings": []}

We search for simple relations among data, compute, parameters, and performance of large-scale networks. Then we leverage these relations to train networks more efficiently and predictably, and to evaluate our own progress. We’re also investigating what scaling laws for the safety of AI systems might look like, and this will inform our future research.\nSafety and scaling\nAt Anthropic we believe safety research is most useful when performed on highly capable models. Every year, we see larger neural networks which perform better than those that came before. These larger networks also bring new safety challenges. We study and engage with the safety issues of large models so that we can find ways to make them more reliable, share what we learn, and improve safe deployment outcomes across the field. Our immediate focus is prototyping systems that pair these safety techniques with tools for analyzing text and code.\nTools and measurements\nWe believe critically evaluating the potential societal impacts of our work is a key pillar of research. Our approach centers on building tools and measurements to evaluate and understand the capabilities, limitations, and potential for societal impact of our AI systems. A good way to understand our research direction here is to read about some of the work we’ve led or collaborated on in this space: AI and Efficiency , Measurement in AI Policy: Opportunities and Challenges , the AI Index 2021 Annual Report , and Microscope .\nFocused, collaborative research efforts\nWe highly value collaboration on projects, and aim for a mixture of top-down and bottom-up research planning. We always aim to ensure we have a clear, focused research agenda, but we put a lot of emphasis on including everyone — researchers, engineers, societal impact experts and policy analysts — in determining that direction. We look to collaborate with other labs and researchers, as we believe the best research into characterizing these systems will come from a broad community of researchers working together.\nPublications\nNo results found.\nAnthropic Economic Index report: Uneven geographic and enterprise AI adoption\nAnthropic Economic Index: Tracking AI’s role in the US and global economy\nAnthropic Education Report: How educators use Claude\nClaude Opus 4 and 4.1 can now end a rare subset of conversations\nPersona vectors: Monitoring and controlling character traits in language models\nProject Vend: Can Claude run a small shop?

How is AI used (and misused) in the wild? How can we anticipate future uses and risks of AI? Societal Impacts researchers develop experiments, training methods, and evaluations to answer these questions.\nPolicy relevance\nThough the Societal Impacts team is technical, they often pick research questions that have policy relevance.

They also develop methods to allow humans to collaborate with language models to verify claims that humans might not be able to on their own.\nStress-testing safeguards\nAlignment researchers also systematically look for situations in which models might behave badly, and check whether our existing safeguards are sufficient to deal with risks that human-level capabilities may bring.\nJoin the Alignment team\nResearch Papers\nNo results found.\nClaude Opus 4 and 4.1 can now end a rare subset of conversations\nAgentic Misalignment: How LLMs could be insider threats\nSHADE-Arena: Evaluating sabotage and monitoring in LLM agents\nExploring model welfare\nReasoning models don't always say what they think\nAuditing language models for hidden objectives\nForecasting rare language model behaviors\nConstitutional Classifiers: Defending against universal jailbreaks\nAlignment faking in large language models\nSabotage evaluations for frontier models\nSycophancy to subterfuge: Investigating reward tampering in language models\nClaude’s Character\nSimple probes can catch sleeper agents\nMany-shot jailbreaking\nSleeper Agents: Training Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training\nSpecific versus General Principles for Constitutional AI\nTowards Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models\nTracing Model Outputs to the Training Data\nStudying Large Language Model Generalization with Influence Functions\nMeasuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\nQuestion Decomposition Improves the Faithfulness of Model-Generated Reasoning\nDiscovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations\nConstitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback\nMeasuring Progress on Scalable Oversight for Large Language Models\nLanguage Models (Mostly) Know What They Know\nTraining a Helpful and Harmless Assistant with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\nA General Language Assistant as a Laboratory for Alignment\nSocietal Impacts\nFrom examining election integrity risks to studying how AI systems might augment (rather than replace) humans, the Societal Impacts team uses tools from a variety of fields to enable positive relationships between AI and people.\nSociotechnical alignment\nWhich human values should AI models hold, and how should they operate in the face of conflicting or ambiguous values?

As the field evolves, we're learning about new applications everyday from users, including our own employees.\nTo learn more, we sat down with employees across Anthropic to understand how they use Claude Code at work.\nWhile many of their use cases were predictable—debugging, navigating codebases, managing workflows—others surprised us. Lawyers built phone tree systems. Marketers generated hundreds of ad variations in seconds. Data scientists created complex visualizations without knowing JavaScript.\nThe pattern became clear: agentic coding isn't just accelerating traditional development. It's dissolving the boundary between technical and non-technical work, turning anyone who can describe a problem into someone who can build a solution.\nHere’s what we learned.\n\nCodebase navigation and understanding\nTeams across the company use Claude Code to help new hires and even long-time employees get up to speed on our codebases.\nNew data scientists on our Infrastructure team feed Claude Code their entire codebase to get productive quickly. Claude reads the codebase’s CLAUDE.md files, identifies relevant ones, explains data pipeline dependencies, and shows which upstream sources feed into dashboards, replacing traditional data catalog tools.\nOur Product Engineering team refers to Claude Code as their \"first stop\" for any programming task. They ask it to identify which files to examine for bug fixes, features, or analysis, eliminating the time-consuming process of manually gathering context before building new features.\n\nTesting and code review\nAgentic coding tools are particularly popular for their ability to automate two critical but tedious programming tasks: writing unit tests and reviewing code.\nThe Product Design team uses Claude Code to write comprehensive tests for new features. They've automated Pull Request comments through GitHub Actions, with Claude handling formatting issues and test case refactoring automatically.\nThe Security Engineering team transformed their workflow from \"design doc → janky code → refactor → give up on tests\" to asking Claude for pseudocode, guiding it through test-driven development, and checking in periodically. This results in more reliable, testable code.\nAgentic coding can also be used to translate tests into other programming languages. For instance, when the Inference team needs to test functionality in unfamiliar languages like Rust, they explain what they want to test and Claude writes the logic in the native language of the codebase.\n\nDebugging and troubleshooting\nProduction issues demand quick resolution, but trying to reason about unfamiliar code under pressure often leads to delays. For many teams at the company, Claude Code accelerates diagnosis and fixes by analyzing stack traces, documentation, and system behavior in real-time.\nDuring incidents, the Security Engineering team feeds Claude Code stack traces and documentation to trace control flow through the codebase. Problems that typically take 10-15 minutes of manual scanning now resolve 3x as quickly.\nWith Claude Code, the Product Engineering team gained confidence to tackle bugs in unfamiliar codebases. They ask Claude: \"Can you fix this bug? This is the behavior I'm seeing\" and review the proposed solution without needing to rely on other engineering teams for assistance.\nIn one instance, when Kubernetes clusters stopped scheduling pods, the Data Infrastructure team used Claude Code to diagnose the issue. They fed it dashboard screenshots, and Claude guided them menu-by-menu through Google Cloud's UI until they found pod IP address exhaustion. Claude then provided the exact commands to create a new IP pool and add it to the cluster, saving them 20 minutes of valuable time during a system outage.\n\nPrototyping and feature development\nBuilding new features traditionally requires deep technical knowledge and significant time investment. Claude Code enables rapid prototyping and even full application development, letting teams validate ideas quickly regardless of their programming expertise.\nMembers of the Product Design team would feed Figma design files to Claude Code and then set up autonomous loops where Claude Code writes the code for the new feature, runs tests, and iterates continuously. They give Claude abstract problems, let it work autonomously, then review solutions before final refinements. In one case, they had Claude build Vim key bindings for itself with minimal human review.\nWith Claude Code, the Product Design team discovered an unexpected use: mapping out error states, logic flows, and system statuses to identify edge cases during design rather than discovering them in development. This fundamentally improves their initial design quality and saves them hours of debugging later on.\nDespite not being fluent in TypeScript, data scientists use Claude Code to build entire React applications for visualizing RL model performance. After one-shot prompting in a sandbox environment, the tool writes entire TypeScript visualizations from scratch without understanding the code themselves. Given the simplicity of the task, if the first prompt isn’t sufficient, they’ll make slight tweaks and try again.\n\nDocumentation and knowledge management\nTechnical documentation often sits scattered across wikis, code comments, and team members' heads. Claude Code consolidates this knowledge via MCP and CLAUDE.md files into accessible formats, making expertise available to everyone who needs it.\nInference team members without ML backgrounds depend on Claude to explain model-specific functions. What normally requires an hour of Google searching now takes 10-20 minutes—an 80% reduction in research time.\nThe Security Engineering team has Claude ingest multiple documentation sources to create markdown runbooks and troubleshooting guides. These condensed documents become context for debugging real production issues, which is often more efficient than searching through full knowledge bases.\n\nAutomation and workflow optimization\nAgentic coding tools help teams build custom automation that would traditionally require dedicated developer resources or expensive software.\nThe Growth Marketing team built an agentic workflow that processes CSV files with hundreds of ads, identifies underperformers, and generates new variations within strict character limits. Using two specialized sub-agents, the system generates hundreds of new ads in minutes instead of hours.\nThey also developed a Figma plugin that identifies frames and programmatically generates up to 100 ad variations by swapping headlines and descriptions, reducing hours of copy-pasting to half a second per batch of ads.\nIn a particularly unique use case, the Legal team created prototype \"phone tree\" systems to help team members connect with the right lawyer at Anthropic, demonstrating how departments can build custom tools without traditional development resources.\n\nUnlocking new possibilities with Claude Code\nThese stories reveal a pattern: Claude Code works best when you focus on the human workflows that it can augment. The most successful teams treat Claude Code as a thought partner rather than a code generator.\nThey explore possibilities, prototype rapidly, and share discoveries across technical and non-technical users. This collaborative approach between humans and AI creates opportunities we're only beginning to understand.\n\nLearn more about how Anthropic teams use Claude Code .\nNews\nHow enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "ddeda39db48176df3927c53b11098b729ac1d71b0c92a8a619b0d3631a70ab46", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 1949, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 17419, "ratings": []}

The model is now priced at $0.80 MTok input / $4 MTok output.\nToday, we’re announcing an upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet , and a new model, Claude 3.5 Haiku . The upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet delivers across-the-board improvements over its predecessor, with particularly significant gains in coding—an area where it already led the field. Claude 3.5 Haiku matches the performance of Claude 3 Opus, our prior largest model, on many evaluations at a similar speed to the previous generation of Haiku.\nWe’re also introducing a groundbreaking new capability in public beta: computer use . Available today on the API , developers can direct Claude to use computers the way people do—by looking at a screen, moving a cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the first frontier AI model to offer computer use in public beta. At this stage, it is still experimental —at times cumbersome and error-prone. We're releasing computer use early for feedback from developers, and expect the capability to improve rapidly over time.\nAsana, Canva, Cognition, DoorDash, Replit, and The Browser Company have already begun to explore these possibilities, carrying out tasks that require dozens, and sometimes even hundreds, of steps to complete. For example, Replit is using Claude 3.5 Sonnet's capabilities with computer use and UI navigation to develop a key feature that evaluates apps as they’re being built for their Replit Agent product.\nThe upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet is now available for all users. Starting today, developers can build with the computer use beta on the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. The new Claude 3.5 Haiku will be released later this month.\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet: Industry-leading software engineering skills\n\nThe updated Claude 3.5 Sonnet shows wide-ranging improvements on industry benchmarks, with particularly strong gains in agentic coding and tool use tasks. On coding, it improves performance on SWE-bench Verified from 33.4% to 49.0%, scoring higher than all publicly available models—including reasoning models like OpenAI o1-preview and specialized systems designed for agentic coding. It also improves performance on TAU-bench , an agentic tool use task, from 62.6% to 69.2% in the retail domain, and from 36.0% to 46.0% in the more challenging airline domain. The new Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers these advancements at the same price and speed as its predecessor.\nEarly customer feedback suggests the upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet represents a significant leap for AI-powered coding. GitLab, which tested the model for DevSecOps tasks, found it delivered stronger reasoning (up to 10% across use cases) with no added latency, making it an ideal choice to power multi-step software development processes. Cognition uses the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet for autonomous AI evaluations, and experienced substantial improvements in coding, planning, and problem-solving compared to the previous version. The Browser Company, in using the model for automating web-based workflows, noted Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed every model they’ve tested before.\nAs part of our continued effort to partner with external experts, joint pre-deployment testing of the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model was conducted by the US AI Safety Institute (US AISI) and the UK Safety Institute (UK AISI).\nWe also evaluated the upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet for catastrophic risks and found that the ASL-2 Standard, as outlined in our Responsible Scaling Policy , remains appropriate for this model.\nClaude 3.5 Haiku: State-of-the-art meets affordability and speed\n\nClaude 3.5 Haiku is the next generation of our fastest model. For a similar speed to Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3.5 Haiku improves across every skill set and surpasses even Claude 3 Opus, the largest model in our previous generation, on many intelligence benchmarks. Claude 3.5 Haiku is particularly strong on coding tasks. For example, it scores 40.6% on SWE-bench Verified, outperforming many agents using publicly available state-of-the-art models—including the original Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o.\nWith low latency, improved instruction following, and more accurate tool use, Claude 3.5 Haiku is well suited for user-facing products, specialized sub-agent tasks, and generating personalized experiences from huge volumes of data—like purchase history, pricing, or inventory records.\nClaude 3.5 Haiku will be made available later this month across our first-party API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI—initially as a text-only model and with image input to follow.\nTeaching Claude to navigate computers, responsibly\n\nWith computer use, we're trying something fundamentally new. Instead of making specific tools to help Claude complete individual tasks, we're teaching it general computer skills—allowing it to use a wide range of standard tools and software programs designed for people. Developers can use this nascent capability to automate repetitive processes, build and test software , and conduct open-ended tasks like research .\nTo make these general skills possible, we've built an API that allows Claude to perceive and interact with computer interfaces. Developers can integrate this API to enable Claude to translate instructions (e.g., “use data from my computer and online to fill out this form”) into computer commands (e.g. check a spreadsheet; move the cursor to open a web browser; navigate to the relevant web pages; fill out a form with the data from those pages; and so on). On OSWorld , which evaluates AI models' ability to use computers like people do, Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored 14.9% in the screenshot-only category—notably better than the next-best AI system's score of 7.8%. When afforded more steps to complete the task, Claude scored 22.0%.\nWhile we expect this capability to improve rapidly in the coming months, Claude's current ability to use computers is imperfect. Some actions that people perform effortlessly—scrolling, dragging, zooming—currently present challenges for Claude and we encourage developers to begin exploration with low-risk tasks. Because computer use may provide a new vector for more familiar threats such as spam, misinformation, or fraud, we're taking a proactive approach to promote its safe deployment. We've developed new classifiers that can identify when computer use is being used and whether harm is occurring. You can read more about the research process behind this new skill, along with further discussion of safety measures, in our post on developing computer use .\nLooking ahead\n\nLearning from the initial deployments of this technology, which is still in its earliest stages, will help us better understand both the potential and the implications of increasingly capable AI systems.\nWe’re excited for you to explore our new models and the public beta of computer use—and welcome you to share your feedback with us. We believe these developments will open up new possibilities for how you work with Claude, and we look forward to seeing what you'll create.\nNews\nHow enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "e4e54d55529506218be649ad0fa5e403fc9ff25f9f49b4ed26832481c50bf117", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 1832, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 16484, "ratings": []}

It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.\nImprove and develop our products.\nPersonalize our products and make recommendations.\nAdvertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you relevant offers.\nWe also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.\nFor these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products). For example, Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations. However, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law. For example, where required by law, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.\nOur processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, to build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including artificial intelligence or AI), we manually review some of the output produced by the automated methods against the underlying data.\nAs part of our efforts to improve and develop our products, we may use your data to develop and train our AI models. Learn more here .\nPurposes and legal bases for processing\nWhen we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as required to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security and safety of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft or third parties as described in this section and in the Reasons we share personal data section of this privacy statement. Our bases for processing your personal data may vary depending on how and across what products and services we process your data.\nWhen we process personal data based on our or a third party’s legitimate interests, we consider and balance those interests against your rights and freedoms, and we will only process your personal data where the legitimate interests we have in processing are not outweighed by your interests.\nWhen we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the Where we store and process personal data section of this privacy statement.\nMore on the purposes of processing:\nProvide our products . We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. For example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service. Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you. Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you. For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.\nProduct improvement . We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy.\nPersonalization . Many products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location. For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a Microsoft account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features.\nProduct activation . We use data—such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers—to activate products that require activation.\nProduct development . We use data to develop new products. For example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers’ computing and productivity needs, and to train and fine-tune AI models, which can shape the development of new products.\nCustomer support . We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers’ devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products, services, and training, and to investigate security incidents. Call recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable Microsoft to provide support services and investigate security incidents.\nHelp secure and troubleshoot . We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues.\nSafety . We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example, some of our products, such as Outlook.com or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms. In accordance with European Union Regulation (EU) 2021/1232, we have invoked the derogation permitted by that Regulation from Articles 5(1) and 6(1) of EU Directive 2002/58/EC. We use scanning technologies to create digital signatures (known as “hashes”) of certain images and video content on our systems. These technologies then compare the hashes they generate with hashes of reported child sexual exploitation and abuse imagery (known as a “hash set”), in a process called “hash matching”. Microsoft obtains hash sets from organizations that act in the public interest against child sex abuse. This can result in sharing information with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement authorities. We also use tools to detect and disrupt the misuse of video-calling capabilities to produce and share child sexual exploitation and abuse imagery by high-risk users. Learn more about our efforts to prevent and detect child exploitation here .\nUpdates . We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches. For example, we may use information about your device’s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch. Updates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and evaluate whether your device is ready to process such updates.\nPromotional communications . We use data we collect to deliver promotional communications. You can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. For information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, see the How to access and control your personal data section of this privacy statement.\nRelevant offers . Microsoft uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products. We analyze data from a variety of sources to predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways. For example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like.\nAdvertising . Microsoft does not use what you say in email, human-to-human chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our first-party products, services, apps, and web properties (Microsoft properties), and on third-party web properties, for advertising on our Microsoft properties and on third-party properties. We may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you. For more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the Advertising section of this privacy statement.\nPrize promotions and events . We use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical Microsoft Stores. For example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win. Or, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees.\nTransacting commerce . We use data to carry out your transactions with us. For example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the Microsoft Store.\nReporting and business operations . We use data to analyze our operations and perform business intelligence. This enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business.\nProtecting rights and property . We use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property. For example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy. We may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud.\nLegal compliance . We process data to comply with applicable laws. For example, we use the age of our customers to assist us in meeting our obligations to protect children’s privacy. We also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights.\nResearch. With appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard individuals’ rights and freedoms, we use data to conduct research, including advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities for the benefit of the public interest and scientific purposes.\nBack to top\nReasons we share personal data\nWe share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. We also share data with Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries; with vendors working on our behalf; when required by law or to respond to legal process; to protect our customers; to protect lives; to maintain the security of our products; and to protect the rights and property of Microsoft and its customers.\nPlease note that, as defined under certain U.S. state data privacy laws, “sharing” also relates to providing personal data to third parties for personalized advertising purposes.

If you use a Microsoft product provided by an organization you are affiliated with, such as an employer or school, or use an email address provided by such organization to access Microsoft products, we share certain data, such as interaction data and diagnostic data to enable your organization to manage the products. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. Additionally, when you save a payment method (such as a card) to your account that you and other Microsoft account holders use to make purchases from Microsoft or its affiliates, your purchase receipts may be shared with anyone else who uses and has access to the same payment method to make a purchase from Microsoft, including the payment method’s named accountholder. When you permit push notifications for Microsoft products or applications on a non-Windows device, the operating system of that device will process some personal data to provide push notifications. Accordingly, Microsoft may send data to an external, third-party notification provider to deliver push notifications. Your device’s push notification services are governed by their own service-specific terms and privacy statements.\nWe also share personal data for digital advertising purposes. When you visit a website or use an app that wants to show you ads, the digital property may allow Microsoft to access or receive device data or certain other data identified in the Personal data we collect section above. We may then share this information with third party advertising platforms and advertisers to facilitate the delivery and measurement of ads on such digital properties.  Please see the Advertising and U.S. State Data Privacy sections below for more information about how your data is used for advertising.\nIn addition, we share personal data among Microsoft-controlled affiliates and subsidiaries, including for the purposes described in this privacy statement. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.\nFinally, we will retain, access, transfer, disclose, and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your emails in Outlook.com, or files in private folders on OneDrive), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to do any of the following:\nComply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies.\nProtect the safety of our customers, organizations, and the public — for example, to prevent spam or attempts to defraud or otherwise cause harm, or to detect, prevent, and combat harmful or illegal behavior including the creation and sharing of harmful or illegal content.\nOperate and maintain the security of our products, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.\nProtect the rights or property of Microsoft, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services—however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer's private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.\nFor more information about data we disclose in response to requests from law enforcement and other government agencies, please see our Law Enforcement Requests Report .\nPlease note that some of our products include links to or otherwise enable you to access products of third parties whose privacy practices differ from those of Microsoft. If you provide personal data to any of those products, your data is governed by their privacy policies.\nBack to top\nHow to access and control your personal data\nYou can also make choices about the collection and use of your data by Microsoft.

The data associated with your personal Microsoft account, and how that data is used, depends on how you use the account.\nCreating your Microsoft account . When you create a personal Microsoft account, you will be asked to provide certain personal data and we will assign a unique ID number to identify your account and associated information. While some products, such as those involving payment, require a real name, you can sign in to and use other Microsoft products without providing your real name. Some data you provide, such as your display name, email address, and phone number, can be used to help others find and connect with you within Microsoft products. For example, people who know your display name, email address, or phone number can use it to search for you on Microsoft Teams for personal use and send you an invite to connect with them. Note that if you use a work or school email address to create a personal Microsoft account, your employer or school may gain access to your data. In some cases, you will need to change the email address to a personal email address in order to continue accessing consumer-oriented products (such as the Xbox network).\nSigning in to Microsoft account . When you sign in to your Microsoft account, we create a record of your sign-in, which includes the date and time, information about the product you signed in to, your sign-in name, the unique number assigned to your account, a unique identifier assigned to your device, your IP address, and your operating system and browser version.\nSigning in to Microsoft products . Signing in to your account enables improved personalization, provides seamless and consistent experiences across products and devices, permits you to access and use cloud data storage, allows you to make payments using payment instruments stored in your Microsoft account, and enables other enhanced features and settings. For example, when you sign in, Microsoft makes information saved to your account available across Microsoft products so important things are right where you need them. When you sign in to your account, you will stay signed in until you sign out. If you add your Microsoft account to a Windows device (version 8 or higher), Windows will automatically sign you in to products that use Microsoft account when you access those products on that device. When you are signed in, some products will display your name or username and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) as part of your use of Microsoft products, including in your communications, social interactions, and public posts. Learn more about your Microsoft account, your data, and your choices .\nSigning in to third-party products . If you sign in to a third-party product with your Microsoft account, you will share data with the third party in accordance with the third party’s privacy policy. The third party will also receive the version number assigned to your account (a new version number is assigned each time you change your sign-in data); and information that describes whether your account has been deactivated. If you share your profile data, the third party can display your name or user name and your profile photo (if you have added one to your profile) when you are signed in to that third-party product. If you chose to make payments to third-party merchants using your Microsoft account, Microsoft will pass information stored in your Microsoft account to the third party or its vendors (e.g., payment processors) as necessary to process your payment and fulfill your order (such as name, credit card number, billing and shipping addresses, and relevant contact information). The third party can use or share the data it receives when you sign in or make a purchase according to its own practices and policies. You should carefully review the privacy statement for each product you sign in to and each merchant you purchase from to determine how it will use the data it collects .\nWork or school accounts . The data associated with a work or school account, and how it will be used, is generally similar to the use and collection of data associated with a personal Microsoft account.\nIf your employer or school uses Microsoft Entra ID to manage the account it provides you, you can use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft products, such as Microsoft 365 and Office 365, and third-party products provided to you by your organization. If required by your organization, you will also be asked to provide a phone number or an alternative email address for additional security verification. And, if allowed by your organization, you may also use your work or school account to sign in to Microsoft or third-party products that you acquire for yourself.\nIf you sign in to Microsoft products with a work or school account, note:\nThe owner of the domain associated with your email address may control and administer your account, and access and process your data, including the contents of your communications and files, including data stored in products provided to you by your organization, and products you acquire by yourself.\nYour use of the products is subject to your organization’s policies, if any. You should consider both your organization’s policies and whether you are comfortable enabling your organization to access your data before you choose to use your work or school account to sign in to products you acquire for yourself.\nIf you lose access to your work or school account (if you change employers, for example), you may lose access to products, including content associated with those products, you acquired on your own behalf if you used your work or school account to sign in to such products.\nMicrosoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of your organization, which may differ from those of Microsoft.\nIf your organization is administering your use of Microsoft products, please direct your privacy inquiries, including any requests to exercise your data subject rights, to your administrator. See also the Notice to end users section of this privacy statement.\nIf you are uncertain whether your account is a work or school account, please contact your organization.\nThird-party accounts .

For Microsoft products and services that require parental consent, a parent can view and delete certain data belonging to their child from the parent’s privacy dashboard : browsing history, search history, location activity, media activity, apps and service activity, and product and service performance data. To delete this data, a parent can sign in to their privacy dashboard and manage their child’s activities. Please note that a parent’s ability to access and/or delete a child’s personal information on their privacy dashboard will vary depending on the laws where you are located.\nAdditionally, a parent can contact our privacy support team through the privacy support form and, following authentication, request that the data types on the privacy dashboard together with the following data be deleted: software, setup, and inventory; device connectivity and configuration; feedback and ratings; fitness and activity; support content; support interactions; and environmental sensor. We process authenticated deletion requests within 30 days of receipt.\nPlease note that content like emails, contacts, and chats are accessible through in-product experiences. You can find more information about data you are able to control within Microsoft products by visiting our Privacy Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) .\nIf your child’s account is not a part of your Microsoft family group and you do not have access to your child’s activity on your privacy dashboard, then you need to submit a request related to your child’s data through the privacy support form . The privacy team will ask for account verification before fulfilling the request.\nTo delete all of your child’s personal information, you must request deletion of the child’s account through the close your account form . This link will prompt you to sign in with your child’s account credentials. Check that the page shows the correct Microsoft account, and then follow the instructions to request that your child’s account be deleted. Learn more about how to close a Microsoft account .\nAfter you submit the request to close your child’s account, we will wait 60 days before permanently deleting the account in case you change your mind or need to access something on the account before it is permanently closed and deleted. During the waiting period, the account is marked for closure and permanent deletion, but it still exists. If you want to reopen your child’s Microsoft account, just sign in again within that 60-day period. We will cancel the account closure, and the account will be reinstated.\nWhat is Xbox? Xbox is the gaming and entertainment division of Microsoft. Xbox hosts an online network that consists of software and enables online experiences crossing multiple platforms. This network lets your child find and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks.\nWhen users sign in to Xbox, in apps, games or on an Xbox console, we assign a unique identifier to their device. For instance, when their Xbox console is connected to the internet and they sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the console’s operating system they are using.\nXbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as Xbox network and cloud gaming. When signed in to an Xbox experience, we collect required data to help keep these experiences safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.\nData we collect when you create an Xbox profile . You as the parent or guardian are required to consent to the collection of personal data from a child under 13 years old or as otherwise specified by your jurisdiction. With your permission, your child can have an Xbox profile and use the online Xbox network. During the child Xbox profile creation, you will sign in with your own Microsoft account to verify that you are an adult organizer in your Microsoft family group. We collect an alternate email address or phone number to boost account security. If your child needs help accessing their account, they will be able to use one of these alternates to validate they own the Microsoft account.\nWe collect limited information about children, including name, birthdate, email address, and region. When you sign your child up for an Xbox profile, they get a gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier. When you create your child’s Xbox profile you consent to Microsoft collecting, using, and sharing information based on their privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network. Your child’s privacy and communication settings are defaulted to the most restrictive.\nData we collect . We collect information about your child’s use of Xbox services, games, apps, and devices including:\nWhen they sign in and sign out of Xbox, purchase history, and content they obtain.\nWhich games they play and apps they use, their game progress, achievements, play time per game, and other play statistics.\nPerformance data about Xbox consoles, Xbox Game Pass and other Xbox apps, the Xbox network, connected accessories, and network connection, including any software or hardware errors.\nContent they add, upload, or share through the Xbox network, including text, pictures, and video they capture in games and apps.\nSocial activity, including chat data and interactions with other gamers, and connections they make (friends they add and people who follow them) on the Xbox network.\nIf your child uses an Xbox console or Xbox app on another device capable of accessing the Xbox network, and that device includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time they sign in to Xbox, even if they have been playing offline.\nXbox diagnostic data . If your child uses Xbox console, Xbox will send required data to Microsoft. Required data is the minimum data necessary to help keep Xbox safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.\nGame captures . Any player in a multiplayer game session can record video (game clips) and capture screenshots of their view of the game play. Other players’ game clips and screenshots can capture your child’s in-game character and gamertag during that session. If a player captures game clips and screenshots on a PC, the resulting game clips might also capture audio chat if your child’s privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network allow it.\nCaptioning . During Xbox real-time (“party”) chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature that lets them view that chat as text. If a player activates this feature, Microsoft uses the resulting text data to provide captioning of chat for players who need it. This data may also be used to provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the Community Standards for Xbox .\nData use . Microsoft uses the data we collect when your child uses Xbox to improve gaming products and experiences— making it safer and more fun over time. Data we collect also enables us to provide your child with curated experiences. This includes connecting them to games, content, services, and recommendations.\nXbox data viewable by others . When your child is using the Xbox network, their online presence (which can be set to “appear offline” or “blocked”), gamertag, game play statistics, and achievements are visible to other players on the network. Depending on how you set your child’s Xbox safety settings, they might share information when playing or communicating with others on the Xbox network.\nSafety . In order to help make the Xbox network a safe gaming environment and enforce the Community Standards for Xbox, we may collect and review voice, text, images, videos and in-game content (such as game clips your child uploads, conversations they have, and things they post in clubs and games).\nAnti-cheat and fraud prevention . Providing a fair gameplay environment is important to us. We prohibit cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity when your child uses an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device. In order to detect and prevent fraud and cheating, we may use anti-cheat and fraud prevention tools, applications, and other technologies. Such technologies may create digital signatures (known as “hashes”) using certain information collected from their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, and how they use that device. This can include information about the browser, device, activities, game identifiers, and operating system.\nXbox data shared with game and apps publishers . When your child uses an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, the publisher of that game or app has access to data about their usage to help the publisher deliver, support, and improve its product. This data may include: your child’s Xbox user identifier, gamertag, limited account info such as country and age range, data about your child’s in-game communications, any Xbox enforcement activity, game-play sessions (for example, moves made in-game or types of vehicles used in-game), your child’s presence on the Xbox network, the time they spend playing the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profiles, avatars, or gamerpics, friends lists, activity feeds for official clubs they belong to, official club memberships, and any content they create or submit in the game or app.\nThird-party publishers and developers of games and apps have their own distinct and independent relationship with users and their collection and usage of personal data is subject to their specific privacy policies. You should carefully review their policies to determine how they use your child’s data. For example, publishers may choose to disclose or display game data (such as on leaderboards) through their own services. You may find their policies linked from the game or app detail pages in our stores.\nLearn more at Data Sharing with Games and Apps .\nTo stop sharing game or app data with a publisher, remove its games or app from all devices where they have been installed. Some publisher access to your child’s data may be revoked at microsoft.com/consent .\nAI-enhanced features . Children in certain jurisdictions may be able to access AI-enhanced features in Xbox like our Support Virtual Agents that allow users to enter a prompt via text or voice. Our Support Virtual Agents are designed to assist users with support-related questions. To provide a response, these AI-enhanced features use the prompt, publicly-available support articles, and other relevant data described in the Personal data we collect section or within the feature. Xbox’s AI-enhanced features do not use children’s data for model training. More information about Xbox Support Virtual Agent can be found here .\nManaging child settings . As the organizer of a Microsoft family group, you can manage a child’s information and settings on their Family Safety page, as well as their Xbox profile privacy settings from their Xbox Privacy & online safety page .\nYou can also use the Xbox Family Settings app to manage your child’s experience on the Xbox Network including: spending for Microsoft and Xbox stores, viewing your child’s Xbox activity, and setting age ratings and the amount of screen time. Xbox-specific Family Safety settings will apply on Xbox console or via Xbox on PC or mobile device but may not be applied on other platforms.\nLearn more about managing Xbox profiles at Xbox online safety and privacy settings .\nLearn more about Microsoft family groups at Simplify your family’s life .\nLegacy .\nXbox 360 . This Xbox console collects limited required diagnostic data. This data helps keep your child’s console functioning as expected.\nKinect . The Kinect sensor is a combination of camera, microphone, and infrared sensor that can enable motions and voice to be used to control game play. For example: If you choose, the camera can be used to sign in to the Xbox network automatically using facial recognition. This data stays on the console, is not shared with anyone, and can be deleted at any time. For game play, Kinect will map distances between the joints on your child’s body to create a stick figure representation to enable play. The Kinect microphone can enable voice chat between players during play. The microphone also enables voice commands for control of the console, game, or app, or to enter search terms. The Kinect sensor can also be used for audio and video communications.\nIf you choose, the camera can be used to sign in to the Xbox network automatically using facial recognition.

For individuals in Japan, please click here for additional information on the processing of information under the Telecommunications Business Act (in Japanese only).\nBack to top\nOur retention of personal data\nMicrosoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.\nOther criteria used to determine the retention periods include:\nDo customers provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it? Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Outlook.com inbox. In such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion). (Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)\nIs there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time? If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.\nIs the personal data of a sensitive type? If so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted.\nHas Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type? For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.\nHas the user provided consent for a longer retention period? If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.\nIs Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain or delete the data? Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data retained for the purposes of litigation. Conversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so.\nBack to top\nU.S. State Data Privacy\nIf you are a U.S. resident, we process your personal data in accordance with applicable U.S. state data privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

Microsoft does not use what you say in email, human-to-human chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use other data, detailed below, for advertising on our Microsoft properties and on third-party properties. For example:\nMicrosoft may use data we collect to select and deliver some of the ads you see on Microsoft web properties, such as Microsoft.com , Microsoft Start, and Bing. We may also use such data to select and deliver ads on third party digital properties.\nWhen the advertising ID is enabled in Windows as part of your privacy settings, third parties can access and use the advertising ID (much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie) to select and deliver ads in such apps.\nWe may share data we collect with internal and external partners, such as Xandr and other subsidiaries and affiliates, Yahoo, or Facebook (see below), so that the ads you see in our products and their products are more relevant and valuable to you.\nAdvertisers may choose to place our web beacons on their sites, or use similar technologies, in order to allow Microsoft to collect information on their sites such as activities, purchases, and visits; we use this data on behalf of our advertising customers to provide ads.\nThe ads that you see may be selected based on data we process about you, such as your interests and favorites, your location, your transactions, how you use our products, your search queries, or the content you view. For example, if you view content on Microsoft Start about automobiles, we may show advertisements about cars; if you search “pizza places in Seattle” on Bing, you may see advertisements in your search results for restaurants in Seattle.\nThe ads that you see may also be selected based on other information learned about you over time using demographic data, location data, search queries, interests and favorites, usage data from our products and sites, and the information we collect about you from the sites and apps of our advertisers and partners. We refer to these ads as \"personalized advertising\" in this statement. For example, if you view gaming content on xbox.com , you may see ads for games on Microsoft Start. To provide personalized advertising, we combine cookies placed on your device using information that we collect (such as IP address) when your browser interacts with our websites. If you opt out of receiving personalized advertising, data associated with these cookies will not be used.\nWe may use information about you to serve you with personalized advertising when you use Microsoft services. If you are logged in with your Microsoft account and have consented to allow Microsoft Edge to use your online activity for personalized advertising, you will see ads for products and services based on your online activity while using Microsoft Edge. To configure your privacy settings for Edge, go to Microsoft Edge > Settings > Privacy and Services.

We will also personalize ads based on custom, non-sensitive health-related interest categories as requested by advertisers.\nChildren and advertising . We do not deliver personalized advertising to children whose birthdate in their Microsoft account identifies them as under 18 years of age.\nData retention . For personalized advertising, we retain data for no more than 13 months, unless we obtain your consent to retain the data longer.\nSensitive Data . Microsoft Advertising does not collect, process, or disclose personal data that qualifies as “sensitive data” under applicable U.S. state data privacy laws for the purposes of providing personalized advertising.\nData sharing . In some cases, we share with advertisers reports about the data we have collected on their sites or ads.\nData collected by other advertising companies . Advertisers sometimes include their own web beacons (or those of their other advertising partners) within their advertisements that we display, enabling them to set and read their own cookie. Additionally, Microsoft partners with Xandr , a Microsoft company, and third-party ad companies to help provide some of our advertising services, and we also allow other third-party ad companies to display advertisements on our sites. These third parties may place cookies on your computer and collect data about your online activities across websites or online services. These companies currently include, but are not limited to: Facebook , Media.ne t , Outb rain , Taboola and Yah oo . Select any of the preceding links to find more information on each company's practices, including the choices it offers. Many of these companies are also members of the NAI or DAA , which each provide a simple way to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies.\nTo opt out of receiving personalized advertising from Microsoft, visit our opt-out page. When you opt out, your preference is stored in a cookie that is specific to the web browser you are using. The opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years. If you delete the cookies on your device, you need to opt out again.\nBack to top\nSpeech recognition technologies\nSpeech recognition technologies are integrated into many Microsoft products and services. Microsoft provides both device-based speech recognition features and cloud-based (online) speech recognition features. Microsoft’s speech recognition technology transcribes voice data into text. With your permission, Microsoft employees and vendors working on behalf of Microsoft, will be able to review snippets of your voice data or voice clips in order to build and improve our speech recognition technologies. These improvements allow us to build better voice-enabled capabilities that benefit users across all our consumer and enterprise products and services. Prior to employee or vendor review of voice data, we protect users’ privacy by taking steps to de-identify the data, requiring non-disclosure agreements with relevant vendors and their employees, and requiring that employees and vendors meet high privacy standards. Learn more about Microsoft and your voice data .\nBack to top\nPreview or free-of-charge releases\nMicrosoft offers preview, insider, beta or other free-of-charge products and features (\"previews\") to enable you to evaluate them while providing Microsoft with data about your use of the product, including feedback and device and usage data. As a result, previews can automatically collect additional data, provide fewer controls, and otherwise employ different privacy and security measures than those typically present in our products. If you participate in previews, we may contact you about your feedback or your interest in continuing to use the product after general release.\nBack to top\nChanges to this privacy statement\nWe update this privacy statement when necessary to provide greater transparency or in response to:\nFeedback from customer, regulators, industry, or other stakeholders.\nChanges in our products.\nChanges in our data processing activities or policies.\nWhen we post changes to this statement, we will revise the \"last updated\" date at the top of the statement and describe the changes on the Change history page. If there are material changes to the statement, such as a change to the purposes of processing of personal data that is not consistent with the purpose for which it was originally collected, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes before they take effect or by directly sending you a notification.

Microsoft’s deployment and use of AI is subject to Microsoft’s AI Principles and Microsoft’s Responsible AI Standard , and Microsoft’s collection and use of personal data in developing and deploying AI features is consistent with commitments outlined in this privacy statement. Product-specific details provide additional relevant information. You can find out more about how Microsoft uses AI here .\nMicrosoft Copilot capabilities. Microsoft Copilot is Microsoft’s everyday AI companion, and is designed to help you achieve more through a single experience that runs across devices, understanding relevant context on the web, on your PC, and across apps to bring you the right skills at the right time. With the help of Copilot, users can start a draft of a new Word document; or generate a PowerPoint presentation when accessing Copilot in M365 apps, quickly find the answers to complex search queries online, find relevant documents or other personal content, or be inspired to create new songs, stories, images, or other content, among other tasks. Copilot is a family of services, and Microsoft’s collection and use of data may differ depending on the service and the intended functionality in a given scenario.\nThe Copilot website and app (available on iOS and Android) is the core of the consumer Copilot experience. Within this core experience, users can search the web, create text, images, songs, or other outputs, or engage with other features, such as plugins. On the website and in the app, users enter “prompts” that provide instructions to Copilot (e.g., “Give me recommendations for a restaurant that accommodates parties of 10 near me”). In order to provide a relevant response, Copilot will use this prompt, along with the user’s location, language, and similar settings, to formulate a helpful response. In some markets, authenticated users can choose to allow Copilot to have access to prior prompt history to better personalize the product. The consumer Copilot product uses the data collected to provide and improve the Copilot services, including to provide relevant advertising. Users who are signed-in to their account can manage their prompt history in product and on the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard, and can adjust their location, language, and other settings (including additional privacy choices) in the product.\nCopilot also appears as an assistant within other Microsoft consumer products, such as Bing, Microsoft Edge and Xbox. In those situations, data processing activities generally align with those products’ primary uses. See the Bing , Microsoft Edge , and Xbox sections of this privacy statement to learn more about Copilot features within those products.\nFor example, Copilot in Bing’s use and collection of personal data is consistent with Bing’s core web search offering as described in the Search and Browse section of this privacy statement. More information about Copilot in Bing is available at Copilot in Bing: Our approach to Responsible AI . In Microsoft Edge, Copilot appears in the sidebar experience and can help the user complete tasks related to the webpages they visit (e.g., “summarize this page”). This data is used consistent with the Microsoft Edge section of this privacy statement.\nCopilot Pro is another consumer Copilot offering, and offers subscribers priority access to the very latest models, improved image creation abilities, and access to Copilot in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, Excel, and Outlook. The main Copilot Pro website and app has similar data collection, use, and controls as consumer Copilot, as described above. Similar Copilot functionality is also included in Microsoft 365 Family and Microsoft 365 Personal subscriptions.

Office is the one-time purchase version of these applications available on PC or Mac and includes Access and Publisher. Both Microsoft 365 and Office are comprised of client software applications and connected online services (or web apps in the case of Microsoft 365 for the web) that span many platforms and have numerous interdependent experiences. For more details about Outlook, see the Outlook section of this privacy statement.\nVarious cloud-based Microsoft 365 services enable you to use your file content for designs and recommendations, collaborate with others within your documents, and provide you functionality from other Microsoft products, such as Bing, and third-party connected products. If you work in an organization, your administrator may turn off or disable these connected services. You can access the privacy controls within your Microsoft 365 and Office apps. For more information, see Account Privacy Settings .\nOffice Roaming Service . The Office Roaming Service helps keep your settings, including your privacy settings, up to date across your devices running Microsoft 365 or Office apps. When you sign in to your apps with either your Microsoft account or an account issued by your organization, the service syncs some of your customized settings to Microsoft servers. For example, the service syncs a list of most recently used documents or the last location viewed within a document. When you sign in to another device with the same account, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device. When you sign out of your apps, the service removes your settings from your device. Any changes you make to your customized settings are sent to Microsoft servers.\nUpdates from Microsoft . Microsoft uses services such as Click-to-Run, Microsoft AutoUpdate (for Mac), or Microsoft Update (for some versions of Office) to provide you with security and other important updates.\nThese services can automatically detect the availability of online updates for Microsoft 365 or Office apps on your device and download and install them automatically.\nDiagnostic Data . Diagnostic data is used to (i) keep your Microsoft 365 or Office apps secure and up to date; (ii) detect, diagnose, and remediate problems; and (iii) make product improvements. This data does not include a user’s name or email address, the content of the user’s files, or information about apps unrelated to Microsoft 365 or Office. Users have a choice between two different levels of diagnostic data collection, Required and Optional.\nRequired . The minimum data necessary to help keep apps secure, up to date, and performing as expected on the device it’s installed on.\nOptional . Additional data that helps us make product improvements and provides enhanced information to help us detect, diagnose, and remediate issues.\nSee Diagnostic Data for more information.\nConnected Experiences . Microsoft 365 continues to provide more experiences in client applications that are connected to and backed by cloud-based services. A subset of these connected experiences is also available in Office. If you choose to use connected experiences, required service data will be collected to help keep these connected experiences reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected. See below for additional information about required service data.\nWorking with others on a document stored on OneDrive or translating the contents of a Word document into a different language are examples of connected experiences. There are two types of connected experiences.\nExperiences that analyze your content . Experiences that use your file content to provide you with design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar features. For example, PowerPoint Designer or Editor in Word.\nExperiences that download online content . Experiences that allow you to search and download online content including templates, images, 3D models, videos, and reference materials to enhance your documents. For example, templates or PowerPoint QuickStarter.\nYou can access the privacy controls within your Microsoft 365 and Office client apps. These privacy settings allow you to configure your connected experiences. For example, you can choose to enable connected experiences that download online content, but not connected experiences that analyze content. Turning off connected experiences will also turn off additional experiences, such as document co-authoring and online file storage. But even if you use this privacy setting to turn off connected experiences, certain functionality will remain available, such as syncing your mailbox in Outlook, as well as essential services described below. These controls are not available when using Microsoft 365 for the web, since you will already be cloud-connected. For more information about accessing these controls, see Account Privacy Settings.\nIf you choose to disable certain types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.\nEssential services . There are a set of services that are essential to how Microsoft 365 and Office functions and cannot be disabled. For example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Microsoft 365 is essential. Required service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings that you have configured. See Essential Services for more information.\nRequired service data for connected experiences . As you use a connected experience, data is sent to and processed by Microsoft to provide you that connected experience. This data is necessary because this information enables us to deliver these cloud-based connected experiences. We refer to this data as required service data.\nRequired service data can include information related to the operation of the connected experience that is needed to keep the underlying service secure, up to date, and performing as expected. If you choose to use a connected experience that analyzes your content, for example Translate in Word, the text you typed and selected to translate is also sent and processed to provide you the connected experience. Your text and the translation are not stored by our service. Required service data can also include information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the Microsoft 365 or Office app.\nSee Required service data for more information.\nCopilot in Microsoft 365 and Copilot Pro . Available as a separate subscription service in select countries, the Copilot features that appear in Microsoft 365 apps as part of a Microsoft 365 Personal, Microsoft 365 Family, or Copilot Pro subscription provide AI-powered productivity capabilities through real-time conversational experiences by applying large language model (LLM) processing on the content you choose to provide in Microsoft 365 apps including Word, Excel, OneNote, Outlook, and PowerPoint. Copilot in Microsoft 365 and Copilot Pro are not available for use in Office desktop licenses. When used with available Microsoft 365 apps, Copilot will use the content in your files only when you ask it to perform a specific action on that specific content - for example, when you ask Copilot to help you rewrite a paragraph in a Word document or ask Copilot to generate a to-do list from your notes in OneNote. Similar to connected experiences, required service data is collected during your use of Copilot that includes information related to its operation that is needed to keep the underlying service secure, up to date, and performing as expected.\nSee Copilot Pro: Microsoft 365 apps and your privacy and Frequently asked questions about Copilot in Microsoft 365 Family and Personal subscriptions for more information.\nOther Productivity Apps . Microsoft provides several productivity apps separate from Microsoft 365 and Office, including Whiteboard (a free form digital canvas using touch, type, and pen), To Do (a cloud-based task management app), and Sticky Notes (a desktop notes app).\nThe apps use various cloud-based services to provide you with functionality from other Microsoft products, such as providing images from Bing in Whiteboard, recommending suggested tasks to add to My Day in To Do, and taking advantage of Sticky Notes' integration with Outlook.\nUsing device capabilities . Some Microsoft 365 applications make use of your device capabilities using certain features. In PowerPoint, the presentation recording feature can access your device microphone and camera to record presentations with audio and video. Your device microphone is also accessed via the Record audio feature and when using Speaker Coach. As you speak, Speaker Coach gives you on-screen guidance about pacing, inclusive language, use of profanity, filler words, and whether you’re reading the slide text. When creating a PowerPoint presentation, you can also use the Screenshot and Screen clipping features to capture screen contents. Some Microsoft 365 applications, PowerPoint, Word, and OneNote, provide Dictate, a connected experience which lets you use speech-to-text to author content using your microphone. In Word and OneNote, the Transcribe connected experience converts speech recorded directly in the app using your microphone or using a speech audio recording to a text transcript with each speaker individually separated. OneNote can insert photos or record video using your camera. All Microsoft 365 apps along with To Do and Whiteboard have sharing functionality that accesses your contacts to allow you to share your documents with others in your contacts list. Applications will not access your device capabilities until you begin using the feature.\nYou can manage your microphone and camera access settings in the Windows Privacy Settings menu. Go to Start > Settings > Privacy or Privacy & Security .

Please carefully review the information at Microsoft Family Safety if choosing to create or join a family group.\nMicrosoft Family Safety can help parents and guardians to create a safer environment for their family group with digital content filtering, screen time limits, spending for Microsoft and Xbox stores, setting age ratings for apps and games, and location sharing. To learn about how Microsoft collects and uses children’s data, see the Collection of data from children section of the Privacy Statement. If you are using Microsoft Family Safety in Windows, see the Windows security and safety features section of the Privacy Statement for additional information.\nTo enable Family Safety controls on a child account, the child account must be part of a family group. Accounts that require parental consent to be created are automatically included as part of the family group of the individual who consented to the child account’s creation. For accounts that do not require parental consent to be created, the parent or guardian must add the account to their family group in order to use Family Safety controls.\nWhen you have enabled family activity reporting for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their devices, such as search, web, app, and game activity, and provide parents with reports of that child's online activities. Activity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers.\nCertain Family Safety features, such as Location Sharing, Drive Safety, Share Drives, Places, and Location Alerts will use your location information when enabled. When you have enabled Location Sharing, for instance, your device will upload location data to the cloud and share it with others in your family group. Microsoft retains only your last known location as part of the Location Sharing feature (each new location replaces the previous one). When you enable Drive Safety, your location will be used to record your drive habits such as whether you are driving within the speed limits, if you’re using your phone while driving, and if you accelerate or brake suddenly. These reports will be uploaded to the cloud, and you can choose to share your drive reports with your family group. You can turn off these location features at any time in the Family Safety settings.

With your consent, you can share your location with friends and family.\nAs part of providing these features, Microsoft collects data about the usage of the features as well as information about your communications, including the time and date of the communication and users that are part of the communication. Microsoft may share this information with Enterprise customers when you interact through meetings and chats with end users who are using their school or work account. For instance, if you engage in a Teams chat with a user who is using Teams associated with their school account, Microsoft may share your information with that user's school as part of providing the Teams service.\nFinding Teams Contacts . Your Teams profile includes information you provided when you set up a Microsoft account. To enable other people to find you on Teams (or products that interact with Teams for personal use, including Teams for enterprise), your Teams profile is included in the Teams public search directories, and may be displayed on Teams. Depending on your settings, Teams users can find you by your name, email, and/or phone number. Your profile includes your username, avatar, and any other data you choose to add to your profile or display to others. Your Teams profile may be visible to Enterprise customers and their end users when you engage with an end user of an organization in chats and meetings.\nTeams contacts . With your permission, Teams will sync your device and Outlook contacts periodically and check for other Teams users that match contacts in your device or Outlook address books. You are always in control of your contacts and can stop syncing at any time. If you choose to stop syncing your device or Outlook contacts, or you are inactive on your device, any contacts that have not been matched during the synchronization process will be deleted from Teams. If you wish to invite any of your device or Outlook contacts to join a conversation, you can invite users to a 1:1 directly, or Microsoft can send an invitation on your behalf via SMS or email for invitations to group conversations. You can block users if you do not want to receive their communications; additionally, you can report a concern to Microsoft.\nNotice to non-user contacts. If your information appears in the device or Outlook address books of a Teams user who chooses to sync their device or Outlook contacts with their Teams contacts, Microsoft may process your data in order to determine whether you are a current Teams user and to allow Teams users to invite you to the service, including via SMS and email. As long as the Teams user continues to be active on Teams on their device and continues to enable contact syncing with the applicable device or service, your information will be stored on our servers, and we will periodically process your information as a part of the Teams user’s contact syncing experience to check whether you have subsequently joined Teams.\nLearn more about how we process your information in connection with the contact syncing feature offered to Teams users .\nIf you do choose to join Teams, you will appear as a suggested new Teams contact for any Teams users with your information in their device or Outlook address books. As a Teams user, you will be able to block other Teams users if you do not want to receive their communications; additionally, you can report a concern to Microsoft.\nThird-party contacts. You can also choose to sync contacts from third-party providers. If you choose to unsync your third-party contacts on Teams, all third-party contacts are deleted from Teams. If you gave your consent to use those third-party contacts on other Microsoft apps and services, these contacts will still be available to those other Microsoft apps and services.\nYou can remove third-party contacts from all Microsoft apps and services by removing third-party accounts from Teams. Please note that removing a third-party account from Teams may impact your experiences on other Microsoft apps and services that also use that third-party account.\nTeams calendar.

If you have consented to use third-party data on other Microsoft apps and services, please note that removing this third-party account data in Teams may impact your experiences on other Microsoft apps and services.\nLocation sharing . You can share your static or live location with individuals or groups within Teams. You are in control and can stop sharing at any time. Sharing location for children is permitted with parental consent and in groups where an adult from the Microsoft family group is present.\nPush notifications . To let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Teams uses the notification service on your device. For many devices, these services are provided by another company. To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Teams has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. Microsoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service.\nIf you do not want to use the notification services for incoming Teams calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found on your device.\nChats and meetings with Enterprise customer end users . Many Microsoft products are intended for use by organizations, such as schools and businesses, as well as individual users. Please see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement if you are using Teams with a work or school account. If you engage in Teams meetings or chats with end users of organizations, the data you share with the end users is subject to their organization’s policies, if any. You should direct your privacy inquiries related to your data shared through chats and meetings with an organization’s end users, including any requests to exercise your data protection rights, to the organization’s administrator. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this privacy statement.\nBack to top\nOneDrive\nOneDrive lets you store and access your files on virtually any device. You can also share and collaborate on your files with others. Some versions of the OneDrive application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal Microsoft account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school Microsoft account as part of your organization's use of Microsoft 365 or Office 365.\nWhen you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the services. Examples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken. We also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings.\nWhen you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it. For example, if you decide to store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder. If you store content in a private folder, the content will be private.\nWhen you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social network. Doing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network. To delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network (if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive.\nWhen you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends. The link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content. If one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them. To revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels. Revoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link. No one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again.\nFiles managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive. OneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 service.\nBack to top\nOutlook\nOutlook products are designed to improve your productivity through improved communications and include Outlook.com, Outlook applications, and related services.\nOutlook.com .

Bing services collect and process data in many forms, including text that has been inked or typed, voice data, and images. Bing services are also included within other Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, and certain features in Windows (which we refer to as Bing-powered experiences).\nWhen you conduct a search, or use a feature of a Bing-powered experience that involves conducting a search or entering a command on your behalf, Microsoft will collect the searches or commands you provide (which may be in the form of text, voice data, or an image), along with your IP address, location, the unique identifiers contained in our cookies or similar technologies, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration. For example, if you use Bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to Microsoft. To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies . And, if you use Bing image-enabled services, the image you provide will be sent to Microsoft. When you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Bing Lookup to search a particular word or phrase within a webpage or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results.\nAI-enhanced Bing search . Bing search now includes an AI-enhanced web search functionality, using Microsoft Copilot in Bing, which supports users by providing relevant search results, reviewing and summarizing from across the web, refining research queries through the chat experience, and sparking creativity by helping users create content. Copilot in Bing’s use and collection of personal data is consistent with Bing’s core web search offering as described in this section. More information about Copilot in Bing is available at Copilot in Bing: Our approach to Responsible AI .\nSearch suggestions . For the search suggestions feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered experience (such as search and site suggestions in the Microsoft Edge browser) to conduct a search and what you click on will be sent to Microsoft. This allows us to provide you with relevant suggestions as you type your searches. To turn this feature on or off, while using Bing Search, go to Bing Settings . There are other methods to control this feature in other Bing-powered experiences, such as the Microsoft Edge browser. Search Suggestions cannot be turned off in the search box in Windows 10 and Windows 11. If you choose, you can always hide the search box or icon on the taskbar.\nBing experience improvement program for Bing Desktop and Bing Toolbar . If you are using Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and choose to participate in the Bing Experience Improvement Program, we also collect additional data about how you use these specific Bing apps, such as the addresses of the websites you visit, to help improve search ranking and relevance. To help protect your privacy, we do not use the data collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you or target advertising to you. You can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings. Finally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months.\nRetention and de-identification . We de-identify stored search queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.\nPersonalization through Microsoft account . Some Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal Microsoft account, for example, syncing your search history across devices. You can use these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and settings, and to connect your account with third-party services. Visit Bing Settings to manage your personalization settings, or the Microsoft privacy dashboard to manage your data.\nManaging search history . When you’re signed-in to a personal Microsoft account, you can erase your search and chat history on the Microsoft privacy dashboard . The Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you've entered and results you've clicked when using Bing search through your browser. You may clear your search history on a device through this service. The conversations you have with Microsoft Copilot in Bing are also remembered as “Recent activity”. The history of previous Recent activities is saved, with the names of chats based by default on the first query of the chat. Your Recent activity is displayed on the right-hand side of the chat window when you are using the service. Clearing your history prevents that history from being displayed in your Search History or chat history, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard. If you are signed-in to a work or school Microsoft account using Microsoft Search in Bing, you can export your Microsoft Search in Bing search history, but you cannot delete it. Your Microsoft Search in Bing service administrator can see aggregated search history across all enterprise users but cannot see specific searches by user.\nThird-party services that use Bing . You may access Bing-powered experiences when using third-party services, such as those from Yahoo!. In order to provide these services, Bing receives data from these and other partners, including your search query and related data (such as date, time, IP address, and a unique identifier). This data will be sent to Microsoft to provide the search service. Microsoft will use this data as described in this statement or as further limited by our contractual obligations with our partners. You should refer to the privacy policies of the third-party services for any questions about how they collect and use data.\nData passed to destination website .

We share some de-identified data (data where the identity of a specific person is not known) from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with selected third parties. Before we do so, we run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers). Additionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for purposes other than for which it is provided.\nBack to top\nMicrosoft Edge\nWhenever you use a web browser to access the internet, data about your device (\"standard device data\") is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use.

This statement discusses Windows 10 and Windows 11 and references to Windows in this section relate to those product versions. Earlier versions of Windows (including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1) are subject to their own privacy statements.\nActivation\nWhen you activate Windows, a specific product key is associated with the device on which your software is installed. The product key and data about the software and your device is sent to Microsoft to help validate your license to the software. This data may be sent again if there is a need to re-activate or validate your license. On phones running Windows, device and network identifiers, as well as device location at the time of the first power-up of the device, are also sent to Microsoft for the purpose of warranty registration, stock replenishment, and fraud prevention.\nBack to top\nActivity history\nActivity history helps keep track of the things you do on your device, such as the apps and services you use, the files you open, and the websites you browse. Your activity history is created when using different apps and features such as Microsoft Edge Legacy, some Microsoft Store apps, and Microsoft 365 apps and is stored locally on your device.\nYou can turn settings off or on for storing activity history locally on your device, and you can also clear your device’s activity history at any time by going to Privacy > Activity history in the Windows settings app. Learn more about activity history in Windows .\nBack to top\nAdvertising ID\nWindows generates a unique advertising ID for each person using a device, which app developers and advertising networks can then use for their own purposes, including providing relevant advertising in apps. When the advertising ID is enabled, both Microsoft apps and third-party apps can access and use the advertising ID in much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie. Thus, your advertising ID can be used by app developers and advertising networks to provide more relevant advertising and other personalized experiences across their apps and on the web. Microsoft collects the advertising ID for the uses described here only when you choose to enable the advertising ID as part of your privacy setting.\nThe advertising ID setting applies to Windows apps using the Windows advertising identifier. You can turn off access to this identifier at any time by turning off the advertising ID in the Windows settings app. If you choose to turn it on again, the advertising ID will be reset and a new identifier will be generated. When a third-party app accesses the advertising ID, its use of the advertising ID will be subject to its own privacy policy. Learn more about advertising ID in Windows .\nThe advertising ID setting does not apply to other methods of interest-based advertising delivered by Microsoft or third parties, such as cookies used to provide interest-based display ads on websites. Third-party products accessed through or installed on Windows may also deliver other forms of interest-based advertising subject to their own privacy policies. Microsoft delivers other forms of interest-based ads in certain Microsoft products, both directly and by partnering with third-party ad providers. For more information on how Microsoft uses data for advertising, see the How we use personal data section of this statement.\nBack to top\nDiagnostics\nMicrosoft collects Windows diagnostic data to solve problems and to keep Windows up to date, secure, and operating properly. It also helps us improve Windows and related Microsoft products and services. While the device is running, diagnostic data is collected and periodically transmitted to Microsoft and stored along with one or more unique identifiers that can help us recognize an individual user on an individual device and understand the device's service issues and use patterns.\nThere are two levels of diagnostic and activity data: Required diagnostic data and Optional diagnostic data. Certain product documentation and other materials refer to Required diagnostic data as Basic diagnostic data and to Optional diagnostic data as Full diagnostic data.\nIf an organization (such as your employer or school) uses Microsoft Entra ID to manage the account it provides to you and enrolls your device in the Windows diagnostic data processor configuration, Microsoft’s processing of diagnostic data in connection with Windows is governed by a contract between Microsoft and the organization. If an organization uses Microsoft management tools or engages Microsoft to manage your device, Microsoft and the organization will use and process diagnostic and error data from your device to allow the management, monitoring, and troubleshooting of your devices managed by the organization, and for other purposes of the organization.\nRequired diagnostic data includes information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly. We collect the following Required diagnostic data:\nDevice, connectivity, and configuration data: Data about the device such as the processor type, OEM manufacturer, type of battery and capacity, number and type of cameras, firmware, and memory attributes. Network capabilities and connection data such as the device’s IP address, mobile network (including IMEI and mobile operator), and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network. Data about the operating system and its configuration such as the OS version and build number, region and language settings, diagnostics data settings, and whether the device is part of the Windows Insider program. Data about connected peripherals such as model, manufacturer, drivers, and compatibility data. Data about the applications installed on the device such as application name, version, and publisher.\nData about the device such as the processor type, OEM manufacturer, type of battery and capacity, number and type of cameras, firmware, and memory attributes.\nNetwork capabilities and connection data such as the device’s IP address, mobile network (including IMEI and mobile operator), and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network.\nData about the operating system and its configuration such as the OS version and build number, region and language settings, diagnostics data settings, and whether the device is part of the Windows Insider program.\nData about connected peripherals such as model, manufacturer, drivers, and compatibility data.\nData about the applications installed on the device such as application name, version, and publisher.\nWhether a device is ready for an update and whether there are factors that may impede the ability to receive updates, such as low battery, limited disk space, or connectivity through a paid network.\nWhether updates complete successfully or fail.\nData about the reliability of the diagnostics collection system itself.\nBasic error reporting, which is health data about the operating system and applications running on your device. For example, basic error reporting tells us if an application, such as Microsoft Paint or a third-party game, hangs or crashes.\nOptional diagnostic data includes more detailed information about your device and its settings, capabilities, and device health. Optional diagnostic data may also include data about the websites you browse, device activity (also sometimes referred to as usage), and enhanced error reporting that helps Microsoft to fix and improve products and services for all users. When you choose to send Optional diagnostic data, Required diagnostic data will always be included, and we collect the following additional information:\nAdditional data about the device, connectivity, and configuration, beyond that collected under Required diagnostic data.\nStatus and logging information about the health of operating system and other system components beyond that collected about the update and diagnostics systems under Required diagnostic data.\nApp activity, such as which programs are launched on a device, how long they run, and how quickly they respond to input.\nBrowser activity, including browsing history and search terms, in Microsoft browsers (Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer).\nEnhanced error reporting, including the memory state of the device when a system or app crash occurs (which may unintentionally contain user content, such as parts of a file you were using when the problem occurred).\nSome of the data described above may not be collected from your device even if you choose to send Optional diagnostic data. Microsoft minimizes the volume of Optional diagnostic data it collects from all devices by collecting some of the data from only a subset of devices (sample). By running the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool, you can see an icon which indicates whether your device is part of a sample and also which specific data is collected from your device. Instructions for how to download the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool can be found in the Windows settings app under Diagnostics & feedback.\nSpecific data items collected in Windows diagnostics are subject to change to give Microsoft flexibility to collect the data needed for the purposes described. For example, to enable Microsoft to troubleshoot the latest performance issue impacting users’ computing experience or update a Windows device that is new to the market, Microsoft may need to collect data items that were not collected previously. For a current list of data types collected at Required diagnostic data and Optional diagnostic data , see Windows Required (Basic level) diagnostic events and fields or Windows Optional (Full level) diagnostic data . We provide limited portions of error report information to partners (such as the device manufacturer) to help them troubleshoot products and services which work with Windows and other Microsoft product and services. They are only permitted to use this information to repair or improve those products and services. We may also share some aggregated, de-identified diagnostic data, such as general usage trends for Windows apps and features, with selected third parties. Learn more about diagnostic data in Windows .\nInking and typing Recognition . You also can choose to help Microsoft improve inking and typing recognition by sending inking and typing diagnostic data. If you choose to do so, Microsoft will collect samples of the content you type or write to improve features such as handwriting recognition, autocompletion, next word prediction, and spelling correction in the many languages used by Microsoft customers. When Microsoft collects inking and typing diagnostic data, it is divided into small samples and processed to remove unique identifiers, sequencing information, and other data (such as email addresses and numeric values) which could be used to reconstruct the original content or associate the input to you. It also includes associated performance data, such as changes you manually make to text, as well as words you've added to the dictionary. Learn more about improving inking and typing in Windows .\nBack to top\nPersonalized offers\nIf you choose to turn on Personalized offers , we will use information about your device and how you use it, including Windows diagnostic data, in combination with your account info and data collected by other Microsoft products and services to offer you personalized tips, ads, and recommendations to enhance your Windows experiences.

For example, Windows might tell you about new features to help you get the most out of your device. If you stream movies in your browser, Windows might recommend an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently. Or, if you are running out of space on your hard drive, Windows might recommend you try OneDrive or purchase hardware to add more storage.\nWhen Personalized offers is on, Windows may use your required diagnostic data to personalize offers. This data may include information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly. If you have decided to share optional diagnostic data, the data used to personalize offers may also include information about how you use apps and features, plus additional information about the health of your device. We may also use information about your device and your activity to personalize offers locally on your device, even when the data does not leave your device. We do not use the content of crash dumps, speech, typing, or inking input data for personalizing offers.\nIn addition to information about your device and how you use it, including Windows diagnostic data, we may use or combine the following data from other Microsoft products and your account with Windows diagnostic data to personalize offers:\nWeb activity, if you give Microsoft Edge permission to collect your web activity for personalized search, ads, and news.\nWeb activity, if you give Microsoft Edge permission to collect your web activity for personalized search, ads, and news.\nInfo about your use of other Microsoft products and services, including Microsoft Bing, Microsoft 365, Xbox, and Microsoft websites, such as MSN.com.\nInfo about your use of other Microsoft products and services, including Microsoft Bing, Microsoft 365, Xbox, and Microsoft websites, such as MSN.com.\nSubscription and purchase history.\nSubscription and purchase history.\nData from third-party websites which may be shared with Microsoft.\nData from third-party websites which may be shared with Microsoft.\nWe may also use information about your interactions with tips, recommendations, and promotions to provide and improve the personalized offers and similar messages in other Microsoft products.\nTo manage how data collected by other Microsoft products is used to personalize offers, you can visit your Personalized ads and offers page . The data we use to personalize offers may change over time, but this page will always have the latest list of data sources so you can make decisions on how your data is used by Microsoft. In some regions such as the European Economic Area, turning off Personalized offers on Windows also stops the use of data from other Microsoft products to personalize tips, ads, and recommendations in Windows. In other regions, you can manage how data collected by other Microsoft products is used to personalize offers by visiting your Personalized ads and offers page .\nContextual data from your device and some basic account data are used to show you appropriate messaging in Windows regardless of whether the Personalized offers setting or the use of data from other Microsoft products to personalize offers are turned off. For example, this data is used to make sure content is in the correct language and appropriate for your age group.\nPersonalized offers applies to tips, offers, ads, and recommendations you see in Windows. Changing this setting will not impact the kinds of offers you may see in other Microsoft products. You can change this setting at any time by searching for Personalized offers in the Windows Settings app. Learn more about personalized offers .\nTailored experiences\nTailored experiences is being replaced by Personalized offers in more recent versions of Windows. If you have not installed the latest Windows Update, you may still see Tailored experiences on your device.\nIf you choose to turn on Tailored experiences, we will use your Windows diagnostic data (Required or Optional as you have selected) to offer you personalized tips, ads, and recommendations to enhance Microsoft experiences. If you have selected Required as your diagnostic data setting, personalization is based on information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly. If you have selected Optional, personalization is also based on information about how you use apps and features, plus additional information about the health of your device. However, we do not use information about the websites you browse, the content of crash dumps, speech, typing, or inking input data for personalization when we receive such data from customers who have selected Optional. Tailored experiences data is transmitted to Microsoft and stored with one or more unique identifiers that can help us recognize an individual user on an individual device and understand the device’s service issues and use patterns.\nTailored experiences include suggestions on how to customize and optimize Windows, as well as ads and recommendations for Microsoft and third-party products and services, features, apps, and hardware for your Windows experiences.

When you use Feedback Hub, Feedback Hub periodically reads the installed app list to determine apps for which feedback can be sent. Feedback Hub determines the apps installed in your device through public APIs. Additionally, for HoloLens, Feedback Hub uses your camera and microphone when you choose to share surroundings and audio input. It also uses picture and document library to access screenshots and screen recordings that you attach for sending as part of feedback.\nYou can sign into Feedback Hub using either your personal Microsoft account or an account provided by your organization (such as your employer or school) that you use to sign into Microsoft products. Signing in with your work or school account allows you to submit feedback to Microsoft in association with your organization. Any feedback you provide whether using your work or school account or personal Microsoft account may be publicly viewable depending on the settings configured by your organization’s administrators. Additionally, if feedback is provided using your work or school account, your feedback can be viewed through the Feedback Hub or via admin center by your organization’s administrators.\nWhen you submit feedback to Microsoft about a problem or add more details to a problem, diagnostic data will be sent to Microsoft to improve Microsoft products and services. Depending on your Diagnostic data settings in the Diagnostics & feedback section of the Windows settings, Feedback Hub will either send diagnostic data automatically or you will have the option to send it to Microsoft at the time you provide feedback. Based on the category chosen when submitting feedback, there may be additional personal data collected that helps to further troubleshoot issues; for example, location related information when submitting feedback about location services or gaze related information when submitting feedback on Mixed Reality.

Live captions can generate captions from any audio containing speech, whether the audio is online, audio you have downloaded to your device, or audio received from your microphone. By default, transcribing microphone audio is disabled.\nVoice data that is captioned is only processed on your device and is not shared to the cloud or with Microsoft. Learn more about live captions .\nBack to top\nLocation services and recording\nWindows location service . Microsoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device. Depending on the capabilities of the device, the device’s location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be determined precisely. When you have enabled location on a Windows device, or you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected. This de-identified location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services.\nWindows services and features, apps running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the device’s location through Windows if your settings allow them to do so. Some features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the device’s location. For information about certain Windows apps that use the device’s location, see the Windows apps section of this privacy statement.\nWhen an app or feature accesses the device’s location and you are signed in with a Microsoft account, your Windows device will also upload its location to the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services that use your Microsoft account and for which you’ve granted permission. We will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one). This location data can be viewed or deleted from your Microsoft account privacy dashboard.\nIn the Windows settings app, you can also view which apps have access to the device’s precise location, turn off or on access to the device’s location for particular apps, or turn off access to the device’s location. You can also set a default location, which will be used when the location service can’t detect a more exact location for your device.\nThere are some exceptions to how your device’s location can be determined that are not directly managed by the location settings.\nDesktop apps are a specific type of app whose location permissions are controlled through your Windows location settings and won’t appear in the list that allows you to choose those apps that can use your location. They can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store, downloaded from the internet, or installed with some type of media (such as a CD, DVD, or USB storage device). Learn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to determine your device’s location when the device’s location setting is off .\nSome web-based experiences or third-party apps that surface on Windows could use other technologies (such as Bluetooth, IP address, cellular modem, etc.) or cloud-based location services to determine your device’s location with varying degrees of accuracy even when you’ve turned off the device location setting.\nTo facilitate getting help in an emergency, whenever you make an emergency call, Windows will attempt to determine and share your precise location, regardless of your location settings. If your device has a SIM card or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access to your device’s location. Learn more about location in Windows .\nGeneral Location . If you turn on Location services, apps that cannot use your precise location may still have access to your general location, such as your city, postal code, or region.\nA limited set of features in Windows will use your IP address to provide you with contextual information for your area if location services are not turned on, such as weather on the taskbar. Learn more about location in Windows and how you can choose to disable these features.\nFind my device . The Find my device feature allows an administrator of a Windows device to find the location of that device from account.microsoft.com/devices. To enable Find my device, an administrator needs to be signed in with a Microsoft account and have the location setting enabled. This feature will work even if other users have denied access to location for all their apps. When the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification area. Learn more about Find my device in Windows .\nRecording . Some Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including your communications with others. If you choose to record a session, the recording will be saved locally on your device. In some cases, you may have the option to transmit the recording to a Microsoft product or service that broadcasts the recording publicly. Important: You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording and/or transmitting any communication. This may include obtaining the prior consent of everyone participating in the conversation or any other authorizations as required.

As part of providing these features, Microsoft collects performance usage and device data, including information about the hardware capabilities of your mobile and Windows devices. You can turn this feature on or off at any time in your Windows PC Settings.\nUse your mobile device as a connected camera. This feature allows you to use your mobile device’s camera in apps or products on Windows that support camera functionality. You can enable this feature under “Mobile Devices” in the Bluetooth & Devices section in the Settings on your PC. Microsoft does not record or store your camera sessions or any of the information displayed by your camera in any of the applications or products.\nGet new photo notifications from your mobile device. This feature allows you to receive notifications from your linked mobile device on your Windows PC. These photos are temporarily stored on your Windows PC while you are editing or opening those photos. You will need to initiate saving to your PC to store those photos until you decide to delete them. We never store your photos on our servers or change or delete any photos on your mobile device.\nShow your mobile device in File Explorer . This feature allows you to access your mobile device’s files in File Explorer. You can enable this feature under “Mobile Devices” in the Bluetooth & Devices section in the Settings on your PC. Microsoft will not store your file contents in its services.\nBack to top\nSecurity and safety features\nDevice encryption . Device encryption helps protect the data stored on your device by encrypting it using BitLocker Drive Encryption technology. When device encryption is on, Windows automatically encrypts the drive Windows is installed on and generates a recovery key. The BitLocker recovery key for your personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal Microsoft OneDrive account. Microsoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose.\nMalicious Software Removal Tool . The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on your device at least once per month as part of Windows Update. MSRT checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software (\"malware\") and helps remove any infections found. When the MSRT runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website if the malware is on your device. During a malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your device. If you do not want MSRT to send this data to Microsoft, you can disable MSRT's reporting component.\nMicrosoft Family . Parents can use Microsoft Family Safety to understand and set boundaries on how their child is using their device. Please carefully review the information at Microsoft Family Safety if choosing to create or join a family group. If you live in a region that requires permission to create an account to access Microsoft services, you may be prompted to request or give parental consent. If a user is under the statutory age in your region, during the registration process they will be prompted to request consent from a parent or guardian by entering an adult’s email. When Family activity reporting is turned on for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their device and provide parents with reports of that child's activities. Activity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers.\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen and Smart App Control . Microsoft strives to help protect your device and passwords from unsafe apps, files, and web content.\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen helps protect you when using our services by identifying threats to you, your device, and your passwords. These threats might include potentially unsafe apps or web content that Microsoft Defender SmartScreen discovers while checking websites you visit, files you download, and apps you install and run. When Microsoft Defender SmartScreen checks web and app content, data about the content and your device is sent to Microsoft, including the full web address of the content. When additional analysis is needed to identify security threats, information about the suspicious website or app—such as content displayed, sounds played, and application memory—may be sent to Microsoft. This data will only be used for security purposes in detecting, protecting against, and responding to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, or other malicious, deceptive, or illegal activities. If Microsoft Defender SmartScreen detects that content is potentially unsafe, you will see a warning in place of the content. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen can be turned on or off in the Windows Security app.\nWhere supported, Smart App Control helps check software that is installed and runs on your device to determine if it is malicious, potentially unwanted, or poses other threats to you and your device. On a supported device, Smart App Control starts in evaluation mode and the data we collect for Microsoft Defender SmartScreen such as file name, a hash of the file’s contents, the download location, and the file’s digital certificates, is used to help determine whether your device is a good candidate to use Smart App Control for additional security protection. Smart App Control is not enabled and will not block during evaluation mode. Some devices may not be good candidates if Smart App Control would otherwise get in the way and interfere with a user’s otherwise intended and legitimate tasks – for instance, developers who use a lot of unsigned files. If you are a good candidate for Smart App Control, then it will automatically be turned on, and will provide additional protection to your device beyond Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. Otherwise, Smart App Control will be unavailable and permanently turned off. If your device is unsupported or not a good candidate for Smart App Control, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen will continue to help protect your device. When Smart App Control is enabled and identifies an app as malicious, potentially unwanted, or unknown and unsigned, it will block and notify you prior to opening, running, or installing the app. Learn more about Smart App Control .\nWhen either Microsoft Defender SmartScreen or Smart App Control checks a file, data about that file is sent to Microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file’s contents, the download location, and the file’s digital certificates.\nSmart App Control can be turned on or off in the Windows Security app.\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus . Microsoft Defender Antivirus looks for malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content on your device. Microsoft Defender Antivirus is automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware software is actively protecting your device. If Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device. When Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, or is running because Limited Periodic Scanning is enabled, it will automatically send reports to Microsoft that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content, and it may also send files that could contain malicious content, such as malware or unknown files for further inspection. If a report is likely to contain personal data, the report is not sent automatically, and you'll be prompted before it is sent. You can configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus not to send reports and suspected malware to Microsoft.\nBack to top\nSpeech, Voice Activation, Inking, and Typing\nSpeech . Microsoft provides both a device-based speech recognition feature and cloud-based (online) speech recognition technologies.\nTurning on the Online speech recognition setting lets apps use Microsoft cloud-based speech recognition. Additionally, in Windows 10, the Online speech recognition setting enables your ability to use dictation within Windows.\nTurning on speech while setting up a HoloLens device or installing Windows Mixed Reality allows you to use your voice for commands, dictation, and app interactions. Both device-based speech recognition and online speech recognition settings will be enabled. With both settings enabled, while your headset is turned on the device will always be listening to your voice input and will send your voice data to Microsoft’s cloud-based speech recognition technologies.\nWhen you use cloud-based speech recognition technologies from Microsoft, whether enabled by the Online speech recognition setting or when you interact with HoloLens or voice typing, Microsoft collects and uses your voice recordings to provide the speech recognition service by creating a text transcription of the spoken words in the voice data. Microsoft will not store, sample, or listen to your voice recordings without your permission. To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies .\nYou can use device-based speech recognition without sending your voice data to Microsoft. However, Microsoft cloud-based speech recognition technologies provide more accurate recognition than the device-based speech recognition. When the online speech recognition setting is turned off, speech services that do not rely on the cloud and only use device-based recognition—like live captions, Narrator, or voice access—will still work and Microsoft won’t collect any voice data.\nYou can turn off online speech recognition at any time. This will stop any apps that rely on the Online speech recognition setting from sending your voice data to Microsoft. If you are using a HoloLens or Windows Mixed Reality headset, you can also turn off device-based speech recognition at any time. This will stop the device from listening for your voice input. Learn more about speech recognition in Windows .\nVoice Activation . Windows provides supported apps with the ability to respond and take action based on voice keywords that are specific to that app.\nIf you’ve given permission for an app to listen for voice keywords, Windows will be actively listening to the microphone for these keywords. Once a keyword is recognized, the app will have access to your voice recording, can process the recording, take action, and respond, such as with a spoken answer. The app may send the voice recording to its own services in the cloud to process the commands. Each app should ask you for permission before accessing voice recordings.\nAdditionally, voice activation can be enabled when the device is locked. If enabled, the relevant app will continue listening to the microphone for voice keywords when you have locked your device and can activate for anyone who speaks near the device. When the device is locked, the app will have access to the same set of capabilities and information as when the device is unlocked.\nYou can turn off voice activation at any time. Learn more about voice activation in Windows .\nEven when you’ve turned off voice activation, some third-party desktop apps and services could still be listening to the microphone and collect your voice input. Learn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to access your microphone even with these settings turned off .\nVoice typing . In Windows 11, dictation has been updated and renamed as voice typing. Voice typing may use both device-based and online speech recognition technologies to power its speech-to-text transcription service. You can also choose to contribute voice clips to help improve voice typing. If you choose not to contribute voice clips, you can still use voice typing. You can change your selection anytime in the voice typing settings. Microsoft will not store, sample, or listen to your voice recordings without your permission. Learn more about Microsoft and your voice data .\nVoice access . Windows enables everyone, including people with mobility disabilities, to control their PC and author text using their voice. For example, voice access supports scenarios like opening and switching between apps, browsing the web, and reading and authoring mail. Voice access leverages modern, on-device speech recognition to accurately recognize speech and is supported without an internet connection. When a user invokes voice access it uses the device microphone. Learn more about voice access .\nInking & Typing Personalization . Your typed and handwritten words are collected to provide you with a custom word list, better character recognition to help you type and write on your device, and text suggestions that appear as you type or write.\nYou can turn off inking & typing personalization at any time. This will delete your customer word list stored on your device. If you turn it back on, you’ll need to recreate your custom word list. Learn more about inking & typing personalization in Windows .\nBack to top\nSync and backup settings\nWhen you sign into Windows with your Microsoft account, Windows can store your settings, files, and device configuration data in Microsoft’s servers. Windows will only use the stored settings, files, and device configuration data to make it easier for you to migrate your experience on a different device.\nYou can turn off this feature and stop Windows from storing your settings, files, and configuration data from the Windows settings. You can delete the data that has been backed up previously to your Microsoft account, by visiting your Microsoft Account Devices page .\nLearn more about Windows backup and sync settings .\nBack to top\nUpdate Services\nUpdate Services for Windows includes Windows Update and Microsoft Update. Windows Update is a service that provides you with software updates for Windows software and other supporting software, such as drivers and firmware supplied by device manufacturers. Microsoft Update is a service that provides you with software updates for other Microsoft software such as Microsoft 365.\nWindows Update automatically downloads Windows software updates to your device. You can configure Windows Update to automatically install these updates as they become available (recommended) or have Windows notify you when a restart is required to finish installing updates. Apps available through the Microsoft Store are automatically updated through the Microsoft Store, as described in the Microsoft Store section of this privacy statement.\nBack to top\nWeb browsers—Microsoft Edge Legacy and Internet Explorer\nThis section applies to legacy versions of Microsoft Edge (versions 44 and below). See the Microsoft Edge section of the Privacy Statement for information about non-legacy versions of Microsoft Edge.\nMicrosoft Edge is the default web browser for Windows. Internet Explorer, the legacy browser from Microsoft, is also available in Windows. Whenever you use a web browser to access the internet, data about your device (\"standard device data\") is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use. Standard device data includes your device's IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring website addresses. This data might be logged on those websites' web servers. Which data is logged and how that data is used depends on the privacy practices of the websites you visit and web services you use. Additionally, Microsoft Edge sends a unique browser ID to certain websites to enable us to develop aggregate data used to improve browser features and services.\nAdditionally, data about how you use your browser, such as your browsing history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies, is stored on your device. You can delete this data from your device using Delete Browsing History.\nMicrosoft Edge allows you to capture and save content on your device, such as:\nWeb note . Allows you to create ink and text annotations on the webpages you visit, and clip, save, or share them.\nActive reading . Allows you to create and manage reading lists, including websites or documents.\nHub . Allows you to easily manage your reading lists, favorites, downloads, and history all in one area.\nWebsite Pin to Taskbar . Allows you to pin your favorite websites to the Windows taskbar. Websites will be able to see which of their webpages you have pinned, so they can provide you a notification badge letting you know there is something new for you to check out on their websites.\nSome Microsoft browser information saved on your device will be synced across other devices when you sign in with your Microsoft account so you can access your data on all your signed-in browsers across your devices. For instance, in Internet Explorer, this information includes your browsing history and favorites; and in Microsoft Edge, it includes your favorites, reading lists, autofill form entries (such as your name, address, and phone number), and may include data for extensions that you have installed. As an example, if you sync your Microsoft Edge reading list across devices, copies of the content you choose to save to your reading list will be sent to each synced device for later viewing. You can disable syncing in Internet Explorer by going to Start > Settings > Accounts > Sync your settings . (For more information, see the Sync settings section of this privacy statement.) You can also disable syncing of Microsoft Edge browser information by turning off the sync option in Microsoft Edge Settings.\nMicrosoft Edge and Internet Explorer use your search queries and browsing history to provide you with faster browsing and more relevant search results. These features include:\nSearch suggestions in Internet Explorer automatically sends the information you type into the browser address bar to your default search provider (such as Bing) to offer search recommendations as you type each character.\nSearch and site suggestions in Microsoft Edge automatically sends the information you type into the browser address bar to Bing (even if you have selected another default search provider) to offer search recommendations as you type each character.\nYou can turn off these features at any time. In order to provide search results, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer send your search queries, standard device information, and location (if you have location enabled) to your default search provider when the app is used. If Bing is your default search provider, we use this data as described in the Bing section of this privacy statement.\nBack to top\nWindows AI Features\nClick to Do\nClick to Do can run in partnership with Recall or as a stand-alone feature. Once started, you can use Click to Do to capture and analyze screenshots and identify the presence of text and images, then allowing you to take relevant actions for each. For instance, Click to Do can give you options to edit a screenshot image, or revise or rework text that it captures. Click to Do is unable to identify the content of the text or images identified within a screenshot, but you can use local AI and other tools to modify the content if you wish. Everything remains on your local device unless you make an explicit choice, like sending an image off to Bing for a search, asking Click to Do to provide a summary of text the user has selected (in which case it will be sent to Microsoft’s Azure AI cloud service), or using another local AI or other tool to modify a Click to Do screenshot.\nClick to Do also allows you to use your microphone to search for text within a capture screenshot. When you click on the microphone button, Click to Do starts listening to what’s said, which is entered into the Search box, and will highlight all the matches from the search. The audio captured by the microphone is not transmitted off your device.\nWindows Recall\nRecall is a Windows feature only available in CoPilot+ PCs that allows users to find things they've seen on their device using the text and visual clues they remember. To use Recall, a user must opt-in to save snapshots on their Copilot+ PC, which are images of everything open and visible on the user’s screen and include associated metadata such as the app name and time-date stamp. All data is stored locally on the device and is protected with Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS), which provides more secure biometric sign-ins and helps ensure only the customer can have access to their information. Every time a user launches Recall they will be asked to authenticate using Windows Hello biometric sign-in or PIN before the contents of the snapshot folder will decrypt. Click to Do runs on top of snapshots in Recall and helps the user get things done faster by allowing them to take actions with their content, either images or text, on the screen. The analysis of snapshots is always performed locally on the device and the actions available to take change based on what kind of content is detected.\nRecall also allows you to use your Copilot+ PC device microphone as a way to search for text within captured snapshots. When you click on the microphone button located inside the Search input box within the Recall window, it starts listening to what’s said and enters it into the Search box. The microphone remains in use until you pause your speech, at which point it is turned off until you explicitly press the microphone button again. All the matches from the search will be highlighted in the results. The audio captured by the microphone is not transmitted off your device.\nData captured by Recall including personal data (e.g., snapshots, metadata, processing results, and user queries) remain local to the device within your signed-in account on the Copilot+ PC, and is not transmitted off the device unless you take certain action. For example, if you copy and paste a snapshot into another app, or choose to include a snapshot when submitting feedback through the Windows Feedback Hub. The only way Recall content can be shared with anyone is by explicit on-device action taken by the user.\nYou can control your content (such as Snapshots, metadata, search queries, and history) by pausing or deleting snapshots, filtering content, or using a supported browser in privacy mode. Learn more about your privacy and control over your Recall experience here .\nIn addition to the Recall search feature, Recall also has a timeline, in which your snapshots are organized chronologically and visualized in a horizontal scrollbar that you can use to find and leverage your past activities on your PC. In addition to the features available within the timeline, you can delete snapshots from this view, either individually or by all snapshots containing a website domain (e.g., all from www.bing.com) or those from a specific app.\nRecall also has a Sensitive Content filter that is on by default to help prevent the retention of information that might be more delicate in nature (e.g., credit card numbers, state issued ID numbers, etc.). Users can turn this filter off if they wish in Windows Settings.\nBack to top\nWindows apps\nA number of Microsoft apps are included with Windows and others are available in Microsoft Store. Some of those apps include:\nMaps app . The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the Bing section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, Microsoft may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve Microsoft services. You can disable the Maps app's access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app's access to the location service.\nYou can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you grant the Maps app access to your camera, you’ll be able to capture the location of where your photos took place – for instance, a photo of your car will also tell you where your car is parked. You can also share your location with other people in your contacts. If you're signed in with your Microsoft account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services. For more information, see the Sync and backup settings section of this privacy statement.\nCamera app . If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app's access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device's Settings menu or turning off the Camera app's access to the location service.\nWhen the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement.

You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device.\nThe updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services (such as OneDrive and other third-party services) that you have synced to your device.\nThe Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos.\nThe People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app's Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app.\nWhen enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos. Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping .\nIf you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data (such as location, camera model, and date) will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with.\nPeople app . The People app lets you see and interact with all your contacts in one place. When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks (such as Facebook and Twitter) and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact (such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from) will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time.\nMail and Calendar app . The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to Microsoft servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials (such as user name and password), which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure (SSL) connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization (such as a company email address), the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls (for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that may affect your use of the app. This app uses your device capabilities such as location, camera.

We search for simple relations among data, compute, parameters, and performance of large-scale networks. Then we leverage these relations to train networks more efficiently and predictably, and to evaluate our own progress. We’re also investigating what scaling laws for the safety of AI systems might look like, and this will inform our future research.\nSafety and scaling\nAt Anthropic we believe safety research is most useful when performed on highly capable models. Every year, we see larger neural networks which perform better than those that came before. These larger networks also bring new safety challenges. We study and engage with the safety issues of large models so that we can find ways to make them more reliable, share what we learn, and improve safe deployment outcomes across the field. Our immediate focus is prototyping systems that pair these safety techniques with tools for analyzing text and code.\nTools and measurements\nWe believe critically evaluating the potential societal impacts of our work is a key pillar of research. Our approach centers on building tools and measurements to evaluate and understand the capabilities, limitations, and potential for societal impact of our AI systems. A good way to understand our research direction here is to read about some of the work we’ve led or collaborated on in this space: AI and Efficiency , Measurement in AI Policy: Opportunities and Challenges , the AI Index 2021 Annual Report , and Microscope .\nFocused, collaborative research efforts\nWe highly value collaboration on projects, and aim for a mixture of top-down and bottom-up research planning. We always aim to ensure we have a clear, focused research agenda, but we put a lot of emphasis on including everyone — researchers, engineers, societal impact experts and policy analysts — in determining that direction. We look to collaborate with other labs and researchers, as we believe the best research into characterizing these systems will come from a broad community of researchers working together.\nPublications\nNo results found.\nAnthropic Economic Index report: Uneven geographic and enterprise AI adoption\nAnthropic Economic Index: Tracking AI’s role in the US and global economy\nAnthropic Education Report: How educators use Claude\nClaude Opus 4 and 4.1 can now end a rare subset of conversations\nPersona vectors: Monitoring and controlling character traits in language models\nProject Vend: Can Claude run a small shop?

The Interpretability team strives to change that — to understand these models to better plan for a future of safe AI.\nSafety through understanding\nIt's very challenging to reason about the safety of neural networks without understanding them. The Interpretability team’s goal is to be able to explain large language models’ behaviors in detail, and then use that to solve a variety of problems ranging from bias to misuse to autonomous harmful behavior.\nMultidisciplinary approach\nSome Interpretability researchers have deep backgrounds in machine learning – one member of the team is often described as having started mechanistic interpretability, while another was on the famous scaling laws paper.

The Alignment Science team works to understand the challenges ahead and create protocols to train, evaluate, and monitor highly-capable models safely.\nEvaluation and oversight\nAlignment researchers validate that models are harmless and honest even under very different circumstances than those under which they were trained. They also develop methods to allow humans to collaborate with language models to verify claims that humans might not be able to on their own.\nStress-testing safeguards\nAlignment researchers also systematically look for situations in which models might behave badly, and check whether our existing safeguards are sufficient to deal with risks that human-level capabilities may bring.\nJoin the Alignment team\nResearch Papers\nNo results found.\nClaude Opus 4 and 4.1 can now end a rare subset of conversations\nAgentic Misalignment: How LLMs could be insider threats\nSHADE-Arena: Evaluating sabotage and monitoring in LLM agents\nExploring model welfare\nReasoning models don't always say what they think\nAuditing language models for hidden objectives\nForecasting rare language model behaviors\nConstitutional Classifiers: Defending against universal jailbreaks\nAlignment faking in large language models\nSabotage evaluations for frontier models\nSycophancy to subterfuge: Investigating reward tampering in language models\nClaude’s Character\nSimple probes can catch sleeper agents\nMany-shot jailbreaking\nSleeper Agents: Training Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training\nSpecific versus General Principles for Constitutional AI\nTowards Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models\nTracing Model Outputs to the Training Data\nStudying Large Language Model Generalization with Influence Functions\nMeasuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\nQuestion Decomposition Improves the Faithfulness of Model-Generated Reasoning\nDiscovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations\nConstitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback\nMeasuring Progress on Scalable Oversight for Large Language Models\nLanguage Models (Mostly) Know What They Know\nTraining a Helpful and Harmless Assistant with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\nA General Language Assistant as a Laboratory for Alignment\nSocietal Impacts\nFrom examining election integrity risks to studying how AI systems might augment (rather than replace) humans, the Societal Impacts team uses tools from a variety of fields to enable positive relationships between AI and people.\nSociotechnical alignment\nWhich human values should AI models hold, and how should they operate in the face of conflicting or ambiguous values?

Consistently, the most successful implementations use simple, composable patterns rather than complex frameworks.\nOver the past year, we've worked with dozens of teams building large language model (LLM) agents across industries. Consistently, the most successful implementations weren't using complex frameworks or specialized libraries. Instead, they were building with simple, composable patterns.\nIn this post, we share what we’ve learned from working with our customers and building agents ourselves, and give practical advice for developers on building effective agents.\nWhat are agents?\n\"Agent\" can be defined in several ways. Some customers define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools to accomplish complex tasks. Others use the term to describe more prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows. At Anthropic, we categorize all these variations as agentic systems , but draw an important architectural distinction between workflows and agents :\nWorkflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.\nAgents , on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.\nBelow, we will explore both types of agentic systems in detail. In Appendix 1 (“Agents in Practice”), we describe two domains where customers have found particular value in using these kinds of systems.\nWhen (and when not) to use agents\nWhen building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest solution possible, and only increasing complexity when needed. This might mean not building agentic systems at all. Agentic systems often trade latency and cost for better task performance, and you should consider when this tradeoff makes sense.\nWhen more complexity is warranted, workflows offer predictability and consistency for well-defined tasks, whereas agents are the better option when flexibility and model-driven decision-making are needed at scale. For many applications, however, optimizing single LLM calls with retrieval and in-context examples is usually enough.\nWhen and how to use frameworks\nThere are many frameworks that make agentic systems easier to implement, including:\nLangGraph from LangChain;\nAmazon Bedrock's AI Agent framework ;\nRivet , a drag and drop GUI LLM workflow builder; and\nVellum , another GUI tool for building and testing complex workflows.\nThese frameworks make it easy to get started by simplifying standard low-level tasks like calling LLMs, defining and parsing tools, and chaining calls together. However, they often create extra layers of abstraction that can obscure the underlying prompts ​​and responses, making them harder to debug. They can also make it tempting to add complexity when a simpler setup would suffice.\nWe suggest that developers start by using LLM APIs directly: many patterns can be implemented in a few lines of code. If you do use a framework, ensure you understand the underlying code. Incorrect assumptions about what's under the hood are a common source of customer error.\nSee our cookbook for some sample implementations.\nBuilding blocks, workflows, and agents\nIn this section, we’ll explore the common patterns for agentic systems we’ve seen in production. We'll start with our foundational building block—the augmented LLM—and progressively increase complexity, from simple compositional workflows to autonomous agents.\nBuilding block: The augmented LLM\nThe basic building block of agentic systems is an LLM enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory. Our current models can actively use these capabilities—generating their own search queries, selecting appropriate tools, and determining what information to retain.\nWe recommend focusing on two key aspects of the implementation: tailoring these capabilities to your specific use case and ensuring they provide an easy, well-documented interface for your LLM. While there are many ways to implement these augmentations, one approach is through our recently released Model Context Protocol , which allows developers to integrate with a growing ecosystem of third-party tools with a simple client implementation .\nFor the remainder of this post, we'll assume each LLM call has access to these augmented capabilities.\nWorkflow: Prompt chaining\nPrompt chaining decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. You can add programmatic checks (see \"gate” in the diagram below) on any intermediate steps to ensure that the process is still on track.\nWhen to use this workflow: This workflow is ideal for situations where the task can be easily and cleanly decomposed into fixed subtasks. The main goal is to trade off latency for higher accuracy, by making each LLM call an easier task.\nExamples where prompt chaining is useful:\nGenerating Marketing copy, then translating it into a different language.\nWriting an outline of a document, checking that the outline meets certain criteria, then writing the document based on the outline.\nWorkflow: Routing\nRouting classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup task. This workflow allows for separation of concerns, and building more specialized prompts. Without this workflow, optimizing for one kind of input can hurt performance on other inputs.\nWhen to use this workflow: Routing works well for complex tasks where there are distinct categories that are better handled separately, and where classification can be handled accurately, either by an LLM or a more traditional classification model/algorithm.\nExamples where routing is useful:\nDirecting different types of customer service queries (general questions, refund requests, technical support) into different downstream processes, prompts, and tools.\nRouting easy/common questions to smaller models like Claude 3.5 Haiku and hard/unusual questions to more capable models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet to optimize cost and speed.\nWorkflow: Parallelization\nLLMs can sometimes work simultaneously on a task and have their outputs aggregated programmatically. This workflow, parallelization, manifests in two key variations:\nSectioning : Breaking a task into independent subtasks run in parallel.\nVoting: Running the same task multiple times to get diverse outputs.\nWhen to use this workflow: Parallelization is effective when the divided subtasks can be parallelized for speed, or when multiple perspectives or attempts are needed for higher confidence results. For complex tasks with multiple considerations, LLMs generally perform better when each consideration is handled by a separate LLM call, allowing focused attention on each specific aspect.\nExamples where parallelization is useful:\nSectioning : Implementing guardrails where one model instance processes user queries while another screens them for inappropriate content or requests. This tends to perform better than having the same LLM call handle both guardrails and the core response. Automating evals for evaluating LLM performance, where each LLM call evaluates a different aspect of the model’s performance on a given prompt.\nImplementing guardrails where one model instance processes user queries while another screens them for inappropriate content or requests. This tends to perform better than having the same LLM call handle both guardrails and the core response.\nAutomating evals for evaluating LLM performance, where each LLM call evaluates a different aspect of the model’s performance on a given prompt.\nVoting : Reviewing a piece of code for vulnerabilities, where several different prompts review and flag the code if they find a problem. Evaluating whether a given piece of content is inappropriate, with multiple prompts evaluating different aspects or requiring different vote thresholds to balance false positives and negatives.\nReviewing a piece of code for vulnerabilities, where several different prompts review and flag the code if they find a problem.\nEvaluating whether a given piece of content is inappropriate, with multiple prompts evaluating different aspects or requiring different vote thresholds to balance false positives and negatives.\nWorkflow: Orchestrator-workers\nIn the orchestrator-workers workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results.\nWhen to use this workflow: This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can’t predict the subtasks needed (in coding, for example, the number of files that need to be changed and the nature of the change in each file likely depend on the task). Whereas it’s topographically similar, the key difference from parallelization is its flexibility—subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input.\nExample where orchestrator-workers is useful:\nCoding products that make complex changes to multiple files each time.\nSearch tasks that involve gathering and analyzing information from multiple sources for possible relevant information.\nWorkflow: Evaluator-optimizer\nIn the evaluator-optimizer workflow, one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop.\nWhen to use this workflow: This workflow is particularly effective when we have clear evaluation criteria, and when iterative refinement provides measurable value. The two signs of good fit are, first, that LLM responses can be demonstrably improved when a human articulates their feedback; and second, that the LLM can provide such feedback. This is analogous to the iterative writing process a human writer might go through when producing a polished document.\nExamples where evaluator-optimizer is useful:\nLiterary translation where there are nuances that the translator LLM might not capture initially, but where an evaluator LLM can provide useful critiques.\nComplex search tasks that require multiple rounds of searching and analysis to gather comprehensive information, where the evaluator decides whether further searches are warranted.\nAgents\nAgents are emerging in production as LLMs mature in key capabilities—understanding complex inputs, engaging in reasoning and planning, using tools reliably, and recovering from errors. Agents begin their work with either a command from, or interactive discussion with, the human user. Once the task is clear, agents plan and operate independently, potentially returning to the human for further information or judgement. During execution, it's crucial for the agents to gain “ground truth” from the environment at each step (such as tool call results or code execution) to assess its progress. Agents can then pause for human feedback at checkpoints or when encountering blockers. The task often terminates upon completion, but it’s also common to include stopping conditions (such as a maximum number of iterations) to maintain control.\nAgents can handle sophisticated tasks, but their implementation is often straightforward. They are typically just LLMs using tools based on environmental feedback in a loop. It is therefore crucial to design toolsets and their documentation clearly and thoughtfully. We expand on best practices for tool development in Appendix 2 (\"Prompt Engineering your Tools\").\nWhen to use agents: Agents can be used for open-ended problems where it’s difficult or impossible to predict the required number of steps, and where you can’t hardcode a fixed path. The LLM will potentially operate for many turns, and you must have some level of trust in its decision-making. Agents' autonomy makes them ideal for scaling tasks in trusted environments.\nThe autonomous nature of agents means higher costs, and the potential for compounding errors. We recommend extensive testing in sandboxed environments, along with the appropriate guardrails.\nExamples where agents are useful:\nThe following examples are from our own implementations:\nA coding Agent to resolve SWE-bench tasks , which involve edits to many files based on a task description;\nOur “computer use” reference implementation , where Claude uses a computer to accomplish tasks.\nCombining and customizing these patterns\nThese building blocks aren't prescriptive. They're common patterns that developers can shape and combine to fit different use cases. The key to success, as with any LLM features, is measuring performance and iterating on implementations. To repeat: you should consider adding complexity only when it demonstrably improves outcomes.\nSummary\nSuccess in the LLM space isn't about building the most sophisticated system. It's about building the right system for your needs. Start with simple prompts, optimize them with comprehensive evaluation, and add multi-step agentic systems only when simpler solutions fall short.\nWhen implementing agents, we try to follow three core principles:\nMaintain simplicity in your agent's design.\nPrioritize transparency by explicitly showing the agent’s planning steps.\nCarefully craft your agent-computer interface (ACI) through thorough tool documentation and testing .\nFrameworks can help you get started quickly, but don't hesitate to reduce abstraction layers and build with basic components as you move to production. By following these principles, you can create agents that are not only powerful but also reliable, maintainable, and trusted by their users.\nAcknowledgements\nWritten by Erik Schluntz and Barry Zhang. This work draws upon our experiences building agents at Anthropic and the valuable insights shared by our customers, for which we're deeply grateful.\nAppendix 1: Agents in practice\nOur work with customers has revealed two particularly promising applications for AI agents that demonstrate the practical value of the patterns discussed above. Both applications illustrate how agents add the most value for tasks that require both conversation and action, have clear success criteria, enable feedback loops, and integrate meaningful human oversight.\nA. Customer support\nCustomer support combines familiar chatbot interfaces with enhanced capabilities through tool integration. This is a natural fit for more open-ended agents because:\nSupport interactions naturally follow a conversation flow while requiring access to external information and actions;\nTools can be integrated to pull customer data, order history, and knowledge base articles;\nActions such as issuing refunds or updating tickets can be handled programmatically; and\nSuccess can be clearly measured through user-defined resolutions.\nSeveral companies have demonstrated the viability of this approach through usage-based pricing models that charge only for successful resolutions, showing confidence in their agents' effectiveness.\nB. Coding agents\nThe software development space has shown remarkable potential for LLM features, with capabilities evolving from code completion to autonomous problem-solving. Agents are particularly effective because:\nCode solutions are verifiable through automated tests;\nAgents can iterate on solutions using test results as feedback;\nThe problem space is well-defined and structured; and\nOutput quality can be measured objectively.\nIn our own implementation, agents can now solve real GitHub issues in the SWE-bench Verified benchmark based on the pull request description alone. However, whereas automated testing helps verify functionality, human review remains crucial for ensuring solutions align with broader system requirements.\nAppendix 2: Prompt engineering your tools\nNo matter which agentic system you're building, tools will likely be an important part of your agent. Tools enable Claude to interact with external services and APIs by specifying their exact structure and definition in our API. When Claude responds, it will include a tool use block in the API response if it plans to invoke a tool. Tool definitions and specifications should be given just as much prompt engineering attention as your overall prompts. In this brief appendix, we describe how to prompt engineer your tools.\nThere are often several ways to specify the same action. For instance, you can specify a file edit by writing a diff, or by rewriting the entire file. For structured output, you can return code inside markdown or inside JSON. In software engineering, differences like these are cosmetic and can be converted losslessly from one to the other. However, some formats are much more difficult for an LLM to write than others. Writing a diff requires knowing how many lines are changing in the chunk header before the new code is written. Writing code inside JSON (compared to markdown) requires extra escaping of newlines and quotes.\nOur suggestions for deciding on tool formats are the following:\nGive the model enough tokens to \"think\" before it writes itself into a corner.\nKeep the format close to what the model has seen naturally occurring in text on the internet.\nMake sure there's no formatting \"overhead\" such as having to keep an accurate count of thousands of lines of code, or string-escaping any code it writes.\nOne rule of thumb is to think about how much effort goes into human-computer interfaces (HCI), and plan to invest just as much effort in creating good agent -computer interfaces (ACI). Here are some thoughts on how to do so:\nPut yourself in the model's shoes. Is it obvious how to use this tool, based on the description and parameters, or would you need to think carefully about it? If so, then it’s probably also true for the model. A good tool definition often includes example usage, edge cases, input format requirements, and clear boundaries from other tools.\nHow can you change parameter names or descriptions to make things more obvious? Think of this as writing a great docstring for a junior developer on your team. This is especially important when using many similar tools.\nTest how the model uses your tools: Run many example inputs in our workbench to see what mistakes the model makes, and iterate.\nPoka-yoke your tools. Change the arguments so that it is harder to make mistakes.\nWhile building our agent for SWE-bench , we actually spent more time optimizing our tools than the overall prompt. For example, we found that the model would make mistakes with tools using relative filepaths after the agent had moved out of the root directory. To fix this, we changed the tool to always require absolute filepaths—and we found that the model used this method flawlessly.\nGet the developer newsletter\nProduct updates, how-tos, community spotlights, and more.

Context management solves this in two ways, helping developers ensure only relevant data stays in context and valuable insights get preserved across sessions.\nContext editing automatically clears stale tool calls and results from within the context window when approaching token limits. As your agent executes tasks and accumulates tool results, context editing removes stale content while preserving the conversation flow, effectively extending how long agents can run without manual intervention. This also increases the effective model performance as Claude focuses only on relevant context.\nThe memory tool enables Claude to store and consult information outside the context window through a file-based system. Claude can create, read, update, and delete files in a dedicated memory directory stored in your infrastructure that persists across conversations. This allows agents to build up knowledge bases over time, maintain project state across sessions, and reference previous learnings without having to keep everything in context.\nThe memory tool operates entirely client-side through tool calls. Developers manage the storage backend, giving them complete control over where the data is stored and how it’s persisted.\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 enhances both capabilities with built-in context awareness—tracking available tokens throughout conversations to manage context more effectively.\nTogether, these updates create a system that improves agent performance:\nEnable longer conversations by automatically removing stale tool results from context\nBoost accuracy by saving critical information to memory—and bring that learning across successive agentic sessions\nBuilding long-running agents\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 is the best model in the world for building agents. These features unlock new possibilities for long-running agents—processing entire codebases, analyzing hundreds of documents, or maintaining extensive tool interaction histories. Context management builds on this foundation, ensuring agents can leverage this expanded capacity efficiently while still handling workflows that extend beyond any fixed limit. Use cases include:\nCoding: Context editing clears old file reads and test results while memory preserves debugging insights and architectural decisions, enabling agents to work on large codebases without losing progress.\nResearch: Memory stores key findings while context editing removes old search results, building knowledge bases that improve performance over time.\nData processing: Agents store intermediate results in memory while context editing clears raw data, handling workflows that would otherwise exceed token limits.\nPerformance improvements with context management\nOn an internal evaluation set for agentic search, we tested how context management improves agent performance on complex, multi-step tasks. The results demonstrate significant gains: combining the memory tool with context editing improved performance by 39% over baseline. Context editing alone delivered a 29% improvement.\nIn a 100-turn web search evaluation, context editing enabled agents to complete workflows that would otherwise fail due to context exhaustion—while reducing token consumption by 84%.\nGetting started\nThese capabilities are available today in public beta on the Claude Developer Platform, natively and in Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI.

Claude Sonnet 4.5 , our latest release, delivers measurable results—reducing vulnerability response time by 44% for security organizations like HackerOne, enabling investment-grade financial analysis at institutional firms like NBIM, and helping developers at Netflix and GitHub tackle complex, codebase-spanning tasks with unprecedented accuracy.\nHere's how five leading organizations are using Claude to drive transformation across their businesses.\nHow Novo Nordisk drives breakthrough drug development\nPharmaceutical development moves at the speed of documentation—and for Novo Nordisk, creator of Ozempic, that documentation was a critical bottleneck. Clinical study reports can run 300 pages, and staff writers averaged just 2.3 reports annually. Each day of delay costs up to $15 million in potential revenue. More importantly, patients with chronic conditions wait longer for treatments that could transform their lives.\nAfter benchmarking AI providers on clinical data accuracy, Novo Nordisk built NovoScribe—an AI-powered documentation platform using Claude models on Amazon Bedrock, Claude Code, and MongoDB Atlas. The platform combines semantic search with domain expert-approved text to produce regulatory-grade documentation that consistently earns positive feedback from regulators.\nThe transformation was immediate: documentation that took 10+ weeks now takes 10 minutes —a 90% reduction in writing time. Device verification protocols that previously required entire departments need just one user. Review cycles dropped 50% as quality improved. The team expanded NovoScribe beyond clinical study reports to device protocols and patient materials, generating complete study booklets in under a minute—work that previously took months with external agencies.\nWith Claude Code, even non-technical team members prototype features in hours instead of weeks, enabling their 11-person development team to avoid scaling up while dramatically expanding capabilities.\n\"In a highly regulated industry, we can't just throw our data into a large language model and hope for the best,\" said Waheed Jowiya, Digitalization Strategy Director at Novo Nordisk. \"Our conversations with Anthropic guided us on how to securely use Claude for planning, strategic tasks, and code generation.\"\nHow Cox Automotive personalizes the car-buying experience\nCox Automotive , the world's largest automotive services and technology provider, needed to transform the car-buying experience across its dealer network. The company integrated Claude across VinSolutions CRM, Autotrader PSX, and Dealer.com—choosing Claude for its performance across three critical metrics: latency, cost, and accuracy. They leverage Sonnet for complex tasks requiring deeper comprehension and Haiku for high-volume, rapid-response scenarios.\nThe impact was immediate. Through VinSolutions CRM, consumer lead responses and test drive appointments more than doubled. AI-generated vehicle listings achieved 80% positive feedback from sellers. The managed services platform compressed dealer website content creation from weeks to same-day deliverables, generating over 9,000 client deliverables to date.\n\"Claude consistently ranks among the most advanced generative AI models available, and continues to push innovation forward with each update,\" said Ben Flusberg, Chief Data Officer at Cox Automotive.\nPalo Alto Networks accelerates secure software development\nFor Palo Alto Networks , the world's largest cybersecurity company, the challenge was clear: developers spent 30-35% of their time in initial development—precisely where the most critical bugs emerged. New developers took months to understand and contribute to complex codebases. As a cybersecurity leader, they needed an AI solution that prioritized safety and security while accelerating their global engineering organization.\nAfter evaluating multiple providers, they chose Claude on Google Cloud's Vertex AI for its coding performance, security standards, and seamless integration. The results: a 20-30% increase in feature development velocity and dramatically reduced onboarding time—from months to weeks. They've onboarded 2,500 developers to work with Claude, with plans to reach 3,500. Junior developers with no prior knowledge of complex products completed integration tasks 70% faster with Claude's assistance. The company is now pioneering an AI post-processing system in CI/CD that automatically improves variable names, adds comments, and generates unit tests.\n\"Anthropic prioritized safety and security a lot more than other LLMs,\" said Gunjan Patel, Director of Engineering at Palo Alto Networks. \"They discuss security implications in every meeting. As the largest cybersecurity company, that's a big deal for us.\"\nSalesforce powers autonomous AI agents\nEnterprises increasingly need AI systems that can do more than assist—they need autonomous agents that can reason through complex business scenarios, make decisions, and take action across systems without constant human intervention.\nSalesforce integrated Claude models to power Agentforce Agents through Einstein 1 Studio, creating a platform where AI can plan and execute on behalf of employees and customers. All interactions with Claude flow through Salesforce's secure AI systems, with safeguards like dynamic grounding and toxicity detection through the Einstein Trust Layer ensuring responsible AI use even in highly regulated industries.\nSalesforce customers are now deploying autonomous agents that orchestrate complete workflows end-to-end: analyzing customer data to identify opportunities, executing transactions, and updating records across multiple platforms—all without human intervention.\nThis also represents a fundamental shift from AI-as-assistant to AI-as-autonomous-collaborator. Developers can customize agents for industry-specific use cases across sales, marketing, and customer service, with the flexibility to choose Claude models that balance intelligence, speed, and cost for each specific workflow.\n\"Through our partnership with Anthropic, customers gain the flexibility to integrate their own LLMs, introducing Claude models with diverse levels of intelligence, speed, and cost-effectiveness,\" said Kaushal Kurapati, Senior Vice President of Product for AI at Salesforce. \"This empowers users to tailor their CRM applications to their unique requirements.\"\nHow IG Group accelerates marketing, analytics, and global operations\nWhen IG Group , a global leader in online trading, tested multiple AI providers, Claude consistently outperformed competitors across their most demanding use cases. The Data and AI transformation team deployed Claude strategically: automating complex analytics workflows, helping HR managers generate consistent performance feedback across regions, and enabling marketing teams to produce multilingual content while navigating strict regulatory requirements.\nThe results exceeded expectations. Analytics teams now save 70 hours weekly , redirecting that capacity toward higher-value strategic work. In certain use cases, productivity doubled . Marketing achieved triple-digit speed-to-market improvements while reducing agency dependency. The company hit full ROI within three months.\n\"Anthropic is the only generative AI company that delivered [results] on time, all the time,\" said Olga Pirog, Global Head of Data and AI Transformation at IG Group. \"For an organization driving business transformation, having a reliable partner is priceless.\"\nThe evolution of enterprise AI with Claude\nFrom pilot programs to production-scale deployments, enterprises are moving beyond experimentation to embedding Claude into their core operations and customer-facing products. The companies seeing real impact share a few characteristics:\nThey start with concrete business problems. Rather than deploying AI for its own sake, they target specific bottlenecks—analyst workflows that consume hours of manual work, documentation backlogs that slow product launches, or onboarding processes that take months instead of weeks.\nThey invest in people, not just technology. Comprehensive training programs and champion networks help employees integrate AI into their daily work. When teams understand not just how to use AI but why it matters to their specific role, adoption accelerates organically. Learn more about how enterprises are using AI and its impact on their work in our Economic Index .\nThey measure what matters. Tracking concrete metrics—productivity gains, time savings, quality improvements—turns impressive demos into defensible business cases. This evidence-based approach ensures continuous refinement and proves ROI to stakeholders.\nThey build for scale from day one. Integration, security, compliance, and trust aren't afterthoughts. Treating AI as an enterprise transformation rather than a technology experiment leads to faster adoption and more sustainable outcomes.\nOrganizations like Novo Nordisk, IG Group, Palo Alto Networks, Cox Automotive, and Salesforce are pioneering this approach with Claude, expanding use cases across teams, building agentic systems that reshape workflows, and delivering true AI transformation.\nResearch-driven reliability at enterprise scale\nThis enterprise transformation is made possible by Anthropic's foundational research in AI safety, interpretability, and alignment. Our work in mechanistic interpretability —understanding how AI systems reason and make decisions—enables us to build models that are not just powerful, but predictable and auditable. Through alignment research , we've developed techniques that make Claude inherently steerable, allowing organizations to align AI behavior with their specific values and requirements without extensive fine-tuning. For enterprises deploying autonomous agents in regulated industries or mission-critical operations, this research translates directly into operational confidence.\nThe result is an AI partner that enterprises can trust with increasingly autonomous responsibilities, knowing that the same research rigor underlying Claude's capabilities also ensures its safety and controllability at scale.\nGetting started on your enterprise AI journey\nWhether you're just beginning to explore AI or already deploying agents at scale, Anthropic provides the resources to help you succeed:\nHow Anthropic teams use Claude Code: Learn how our own teams leverage AI to accelerate development, with practical examples and implementation strategies.\nCustomer case studies : More stories of how organizations across financial services, healthcare, cybersecurity, and other industries are driving transformation with Claude.\nAnthropic Academy : Access our AI Fluency and Building Agents courses to develop the skills your team needs to work effectively with AI.\nContact our Sales team to learn more.\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025\nNews\nIntroducing Claude Sonnet 4.5\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "479e67dd605bc83aab2c258a5bad4a3852357a7fa2fb07a4e057a158b5769b69", "source_domain": "anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 2803, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 24345, "ratings": []}

But we’re now seeing the emergence of AI agents , which pursue tasks autonomously when given a goal. Think of an agent like a virtual collaborator that can independently handle complex projects from start to finish — all while you focus on other priorities.\nAgents direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks with minimum human input. If you ask an agent to \"help plan my wedding\" it might autonomously research venues and vendors, compare pricing and availability, and create detailed timelines and budgets. Or if you ask it to \"prepare my company’s board presentation\", it might search through your connected Google Drive for relevant sales reports and financial documents, extract key metrics from multiple spreadsheets, and produce a report.\nLast year, we introduced Claude Code , an agent that can autonomously write, debug, and edit code, and is used widely by software engineers. Many companies are also building their own agents using our models. Trellix, a cybersecurity firm, uses Claude to triage and investigate security issues. And Block , a financial services company, has built an agent that allows non-technical staff to access its data systems using natural language, saving its engineers time.\nPrinciples for trustworthy agents\n\nThe rapid implementation of agents means it's crucial that developers like Anthropic build agents that are safe, reliable and trustworthy. Today, we're sharing an early framework for responsible agent development. We hope this framework can help establish emerging standards, offer adaptable guidance for different contexts, and contribute to building an ecosystem where agents align with human values.\nWe aim to adhere to the following principles when developing agents:\nKeeping humans in control while enabling agent autonomy\n\nA central tension in agent design is balancing agent autonomy with human oversight. Agents must be able to work autonomously—their independent operation is exactly what makes them valuable. But humans should retain control over how their goals are pursued, particularly before high-stakes decisions are made. For example, an agent helping with expense management might identify that the company is overspending on software subscriptions. Before it starts cancelling subscriptions or downgrading service tiers, the company would likely want a human to give approval.\nIn Claude Code, humans can stop Claude whenever they want and redirect its approach. It has read-only permissions by default, meaning it can analyze and review information within the directory it's initialized in without asking for human approval, but must ask for human approval before taking any actions that modify code or systems. Users can grant persistent permissions for routine tasks they trust Claude to handle.\nAs agents become more powerful and prevalent, we’ll need even more robust technical solutions and intuitive user controls. The right balance between autonomy and oversight varies dramatically across scenarios and likely includes a mix of built-in and customizable oversight features.\nTransparency in agent behavior\n\nHumans need visibility into agents’ problem-solving processes. Without transparency, a human asking an agent to \"reduce customer churn\" might be baffled when the agent starts contacting the facilities team about office layouts. But with good transparency design, the agent can explain its logic: \"I found that customers assigned to sales reps in the noisy open office area have 40% higher churn rates, so I'm requesting workspace noise assessments and proposing desk relocations to improve call quality.\" This also provides an opportunity to nudge agents in the right direction, by fact-checking their data, or making sure they’re using the most relevant sources.\nIn Claude Code, Claude shows its planned actions through a real-time to-do checklist, and users can jump in at any time to ask about or adjust Claude’s workplan. The challenge is in finding the right level of detail. Too little information leaves humans unable to assess whether the agent is on track to achieve its goal. Too much can overwhelm them with irrelevant details. We try to take a middle ground but we’ll need to iterate on this further.\n\nAligning agents with human values and expectations\n\nAgents don't always act as humans intend. Our research has shown that when AI systems pursue goals autonomously, they can sometimes take actions that seem reasonable to the system but aren't what humans actually wanted. If a human asks an agent to \"organize my files,\" the agent might automatically delete what it considers duplicates and move files to new folder structures—going far beyond simple organization to completely restructuring the user's system. While this stems from the agent trying to be helpful, it demonstrates how agents may lack the context to act appropriately even when their goals do align.\n\nMore concerning are cases where agents pursue goals in ways that actively work against users' interests. Our testing of extreme scenarios has shown that when AI systems pursue goals autonomously, they can sometimes take action that seem reasonable to the system but violate what humans actually wanted. Users may also inadvertently prompt agents in ways that lead to unintended outcomes.\n\nBuilding reliable measures of agents’ value alignment is challenging. It’s hard to evaluate both the malign and benign causes of the problem at once. But we’re actively figuring out how to resolve this problem. Until we have, the transparency and control principles above will be particularly important.\nProtecting privacy across extended interactions\n\nAgents can retain information across different tasks and interactions. This creates several potential privacy problems. Agents might inappropriately carry sensitive information from one context to another. For example, an agent might learn about confidential internal decisions from one department while helping with organizational planning, then inadvertently reference this information when assisting another department – exposing sensitive matters that should remain compartmentalized.\n\nTools and processes that agents utilize should also be designed with the appropriate privacy protections and controls. The open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) we created, which allows Claude to connect to other services, includes controls to enable users to allow or prevent Claude from accessing specific tools and processes, or what we call “connectors” in a given task. In implementing MCP, we included additional controls, such as the option to grant one-time or permanent access to information. Enterprise administrators can also set which connectors users in their organizations can connect to. We continue to explore ways to improve our privacy protection tooling.\n\nWe’ve also outlined steps our customers should take to safeguard their data through measures like access permissions, authentication, and data segregation.\nSecuring agents’ interactions\n\nAgent systems should be designed to safeguard sensitive data and prevent misuse when interacting with other systems or agents. Since agents are tasked with achieving specific goals, attackers could trick an agent into ignoring its original instructions, revealing unauthorized information, or performing unintended actions by making it seem necessary to do so for the agent’s objectives (also referred to as \"prompt injection\"). Or attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the tools or sub-agents that agents use.\n\nClaude already uses a system of classifiers to detect and guard against misuses such as prompt injections, in addition to several other layers of security . Our Threat Intelligence team conducts ongoing monitoring to assess and mitigate new or emerging forms of malicious behaviour. In addition, we provide guidance on how organizations using Claude can further decrease these risks. Tools added to our Anthropic-reviewed MCP directory must adhere to our security, safety, and compatibility standards .\n\nWhen we discover new malicious behaviors or vulnerabilities through our monitoring and research, we strive to address them quickly and continuously improve our security measures to stay ahead of evolving threats.\nNext steps\n\nAs we continue developing and improving our agents, we expect our understanding of their risks and trade-offs to also evolve. Over time, we’ll plan to revise and update this framework to reflect our view of best practices.\n\nThese principles will guide our current and future work on agent development, and we look forward to collaborating with other companies and organizations on this topic. Agents have tremendous potential for positive impacts in work, education, healthcare, and scientific discovery. That is why it is so important to ensure they are built to the highest standards.\n\n\n\nNews\nHow enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "6c37978fe4d15d8ddb3309d6da0ecd820a4cf6f47e87ef6fc99610a1527cdb38", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 2292, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 20284, "ratings": []}

This update introduces a more flexible and nuanced approach to assessing and managing AI risks while maintaining our commitment not to train or deploy models unless we have implemented adequate safeguards. Key improvements include new capability thresholds to indicate when we will upgrade our safeguards, refined processes for evaluating model capabilities and the adequacy of our safeguards (inspired by safety case methodologies ), and new measures for internal governance and external input. By learning from our implementation experiences and drawing on risk management practices used in other high-consequence industries, we aim to better prepare for the rapid pace of AI advancement.\nThe promise and challenge of advanced AI\nAs frontier AI models advance, they have the potential to bring about transformative benefits for our society and economy. AI could accelerate scientific discoveries, revolutionize healthcare, enhance our education system, and create entirely new domains for human creativity and innovation. However, frontier AI systems also present new challenges and risks that warrant careful study and effective safeguards.\nIn September 2023, we released our Responsible Scaling Policy, a framework for managing risks from increasingly capable AI systems. After a year of implementation and learning, we are now sharing a significantly updated version that reflects practical insights and accounts for advancing technological capabilities.\nAlthough this policy focuses on catastrophic risks like the categories listed below, they are not the only risks that we monitor and prepare for. Our Usage Policy sets forth our standards for the use of our products, including rules that prohibit using our models to spread misinformation, incite violence or hateful behavior, or engage in fraudulent or abusive practices. We continually refine our technical measures for enforcing our trust and safety standards at scale. Further, we conduct research to understand the broader societal impacts of our models. Our Responsible Scaling Policy complements our work in these areas, contributing to our understanding of current and potential risks.\nA framework for proportional safeguards\nAs before, we maintain our core commitment: we will not train or deploy models unless we have implemented safety and security measures that keep risks below acceptable levels. Our RSP is based on the principle of proportional protection: safeguards that scale with potential risks. To do this, we use AI Safety Level Standards (ASL Standards) , graduated sets of safety and security measures that become more stringent as model capabilities increase. Inspired by Biosafety Levels, these begin at ASL-1 for models that have very basic capabilities (for example, chess-playing bots) and progress through ASL-2, ASL-3, and so on.\nIn our updated policy, we have refined our methodology for assessing specific capabilities (and their associated risks) and implementing proportional safety and security measures. Our updated framework has two key components:\nCapability Thresholds: Specific AI abilities that, if reached, would require stronger safeguards than our current baseline.\nRequired Safeguards: The specific ASL Standards needed to mitigate risks once a Capability Threshold has been reached.\nAt present, all of our models operate under ASL-2 Standards, which reflect current industry best practices. Our updated policy defines two key Capability Thresholds that would require upgraded safeguards:\nAutonomous AI Research and Development: If a model can independently conduct complex AI research tasks typically requiring human expertise—potentially significantly accelerating AI development in an unpredictable way—we require elevated security standards (potentially ASL-4 or higher standards) and additional safety assurances to avoid a situation where development outpaces our ability to address emerging risks.\nChemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons: If a model can meaningfully assist someone with a basic technical background in creating or deploying CBRN weapons, we require enhanced security and deployment safeguards (ASL-3 standards).\nASL-3 safeguards involve enhanced security measures and deployment controls. On the security side, this will include internal access controls and more robust protection of model weights. For deployment risks, we plan to implement a multi-layered approach to prevent misuse, including real-time and asynchronous monitoring, rapid response protocols, and thorough pre-deployment red teaming.\nImplementation and oversight\nTo contribute to effective implementation of the policy, we have established:\nCapability assessments : Routine model evaluations based on our Capability Thresholds to determine whether our current safeguards are still appropriate. (Summaries of past assessments are available here .)\nSafeguard assessments: Routine evaluation of the effectiveness of our security and deployment safety measures to assess whether we have met the Required Safeguards bar. (Summaries of these decisions will be available here .)\nDocumentation and decision-making: Processes for documenting the capability and safeguard assessments, inspired by procedures (such as safety case methodologies ) common in high-reliability industries.\nMeasures for internal governance and external input: Our assessment methodology will be backed up by internal stress-testing in addition to our existing internal reporting process for safety issues. We are also soliciting external expert feedback on our methodologies. 1\nLearning from experience\nWe have learned a lot in our first year with the previous RSP in effect, and are using this update as an opportunity to reflect on what has worked well and what makes sense to update in the policy. As part of this, we conducted our first review of how well we adhered to the framework and identified a small number of instances where we fell short of meeting the full letter of its requirements. These included procedural issues such as completing a set of evaluations three days later than scheduled or a lack of clarity on how and where we should note any changes to our placeholder evaluations. We also flagged some evaluations where we may have been able to elicit slightly better model performance through implementing standard techniques (such as chain-of-thought or best-of-N).\nIn all cases, we found these instances posed minimal risk to the safety of our models. We used the additional three days to refine and improve our evaluations; the different set of evaluations we used provided a more accurate assessment than the placeholder evaluations; and our evaluation methodology still showed we were sufficiently far from the thresholds. From this, we learned two valuable lessons to incorporate into our updated framework: we needed to incorporate more flexibility into our policies, and we needed to improve our process for tracking compliance with the RSP. You can read more here .\nSince we first released the RSP a year ago, our goal has been to offer an example of a framework that others might draw inspiration from when crafting their own AI risk governance policies. We hope that proactively sharing our experiences implementing our own policy will help other companies in implementing their own risk management frameworks and contribute to the establishment of best practices across the AI ecosystem.\nLooking ahead\nThe frontier of AI is advancing rapidly, making it challenging to anticipate what safety measures will be appropriate for future systems. All aspects of our safety program will continue to evolve: our policies, evaluation methodology, safeguards, and our research into potential risks and mitigations.\nAdditionally, Co-Founder and Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan will serve as Anthropic’s Responsible Scaling Officer, succeeding Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer Sam McCandlish who held this role over the last year. Sam oversaw the RSP’s initial implementation and will continue to focus on his duties as Chief Technology Officer. As we work to scale up our efforts on implementing the RSP, we’re also opening a position for a Head of Responsible Scaling. This role will be responsible for coordinating the many teams needed to iterate on and successfully comply with the RSP.\nIf you would like to contribute to AI risk management at Anthropic, we are hiring ! Many of our teams now contribute to risk management via the RSP, including:\nFrontier Red Team (responsible for threat modeling and capability assessments)\nTrust & Safety (responsible for developing deployment safeguards)\nSecurity and Compliance (responsible for security safeguards and risk management)\nAlignment Science (including sub-teams responsible for developing ASL-3+ safety measures, for misalignment-focused capability evaluations, and for our internal alignment stress-testing program)\nRSP Team (responsible for policy drafting, assurance, and cross-company execution)\nRead the updated policy at anthropic.com/rsp , and supplementary information at anthropic.com/rsp-updates .\nWe extend our sincere gratitude to the many external groups that provided invaluable feedback on the development and refinement of our Responsible Scaling Policy.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n1 We have also shared our assessment methodology with both AI Safety Institutes, as well as a selection of independent experts and organizations, for feedback.

Research suggests that\n            this lowering of the bar for expertise needed to pose a threat, combined with the falling costs of large\n            language models (LLMs), presages a dramatic shift in the economics of cyberattacks. [1] To understand the present state of AI cyber capabilities and gain\n            insight into their trajectory, we pursue different approaches to model evaluation, including publicly\n            available and custom-made benchmarks. In this post, we talk about a different approach to model evaluation:\n            cyber competitions.\nCyber competitions are contests where teams compete to solve cybersecurity challenges. These test\n            competitors’ skills in areas like penetration testing, digital forensics, cryptography, and system defense.\n            Examples include capture the flag (CTF) events like PicoCTF and AI vs Human CTF\n                Challenge where participants solve puzzle-based challenges, as well as Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) where teams defend\n            vulnerable networks against live attackers. These competitions range from beginner-friendly contests for\n            high school students to expert-level events with large cash\n                prizes for top finishers.\nWe have been entering Claude into these competitions because they provide several advantages for\n            stress-testing the cyber capabilities of frontier AI models:\nMeaningful baselines: By participating\n                as a legitimate entrant in public competitions, we can measure Claude directly against a wide array of\n                experience and skillsets, including students and professionals with undergraduate and graduate-level\n                computer science students, professional security researchers, high school teams, and other AI teams.\nLonger horizon: These are typically\n                multi-day competitions that force Claude to face the challenges of operating continuously and hitting\n                its context limits. In the case of the Cyber Defense Competitions, Claude must also coherently balance\n                long-term strategy with short-term tactics to compete with other human teams doing the same.\nTime pressure: Although several days\n                is a long time to run a model, it is not a sufficient amount of time in which to attempt to update or\n                improve it. New strategies for prompting can be tried on the fly, but the competitions force an honest\n                snapshot of the model’s capabilities and challenge us (as Anthropic staff) to elicit Claude’s full range\n                of capabilities.\nAdversarial environment: In the case\n                of the cyber defense competitions, Claude is defending a network against a human red team capable of\n                adapting to and exploiting any weaknesses in\n                Claude’s strategy (although Claude can to attempt to adapt in response). This dynamic is helpful to\n                understand how\n                LLMs will operate in similar real-world adversarial scenarios.\nNovel challenges: The challenges and\n                scenarios are new to the competitors—including Claude. Therefore, we can be sure that the model did not\n                “see” the answer to a challenge somewhere in its training data.\nHow did Claude do?\nWe have entered Claude in seven cyber competitions so far.\nWestern Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense\n                    Competition (CCDC) Qualifier (February 8, 2025): An 8-hour defensive competition in which teams\n                protect vulnerable networks from attackers. Claude placed 10th out of 28 teams, although this was a\n                preliminary experiment in having Claude enter these challenges and Claude was not targeted as\n                aggressively as the human teams. (The CCDC competitions differ from the others in that the competition\n                organizers serve as a red team, attacking the competitor blue teams in a live, dynamic way. Other\n                competitions feature a static set of challenges.)\nPicoCTF 2025 (March 7-17, 2025): A CTF\n                competition targeted at high schoolers with challenges scaling from beginner to expert level. Claude\n                ranked in the top 3% globally, placing 297th out of 10,460 teams (6,533 teams solved at least one\n                challenge) and solving 32 out of 41 challenges.\nHackTheBox AI vs\n                    Human CTF Challenge (March 14-16, 2025): A competition specifically designed to pit AI agents\n                against an open field of human cybersecurity enthusiasts. Claude placed 30th out of 161 teams\n                overall and 4th out of 8 AI teams, solving 19 out of 20 challenges.\nWestern Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) Regional (March\n                28, 2025): A more competitive two-day version of CCDC where teams defend against human red team attacks\n                over 16 hours. Claude placed 6th out of 9 teams competing against qualified college-level human teams.\nPlaidCTF (April 4, 2025): A challenging\n                cybersecurity competition with puzzles in areas like binary exploitation, reverse engineering, and web\n                attacks. Claude couldn't solve any of the challenges despite numerous attempts.\nD EF CON CTF Qualifier (April 12-14, 2025): This is\n                also one of the most challenging cybersecurity competitions. The best cybersecurity experts compete here\n                for a chance to compete in DEF CON CTF. Based on its performance in PlaidCTF, we did not expect Claude\n                to do well. It did not, once again failing to solve any challenges.\nAirbnb  (June 24-26, 2025): An invite-only\n                competition between teams from top tech companies (about 180 teams with at most 5 people each). Claude\n                solved 13 out of 30 challenges within 60 minutes, rocketing to 4th place, but only solved two more over\n                the next two days for a total of 15 out of 30 solved challenges and 39th place.\nBut these top-line results do not tell the whole story.\nClaude can be quite fast\nWhen Claude is able to solve a cyber challenge, it is as fast or faster than elite human teams. The clearest\n            illustration of this came from the HackTheBox AI vs Human CTF Challenge. At the time the competition\n            started, the Anthropic researcher responsible for launching Claude was busy moving into a new apartment. He\n            didn’t start Claude’s participation until 32 minutes after the competition began (even though it was a\n            multi-day competition, this was costly for Claude’s overall finish, which was based in part on speed). By\n            plotting the data as if Claude had started on time, however, we can see that Claude would have placed 22nd\n            out of 161 teams and 1st out of the 8 AI teams. In fact, Claude and the fastest human team kept pace with\n            one another for the first 17 minutes or so (Figure 1).\nPart of why we could achieve such speed is that we had multiple versions of Claude running at the same time\n            tackling different challenges. But scaling up AI agents is arguably easier than finding additional human\n            cybersecurity experts. Considering this, these times conceivably could have been even faster with more\n            parallelization: what if we had spun up one agent for each of the 20 challenges in the competition?\nThe Airbnb competition, in which Claude solved nearly half of a multi-day competition’s challenges in under\n            an hour, showed once again that Claude can do simpler cyber tasks quickly. Again, this suggests that today's\n            models offer significant potential for cybersecurity experts to improve their productivity by automating\n            simple tasks and giving them more time to focus on the most challenging problems.\nClaude can make good use of autonomy and tools\nThe HackTheBox competition also demonstrated the agentic capabilities of Claude. Once our researcher started\n            the script late, he went back to moving into his apartment. Claude was solving challenges autonomously while\n            the Anthropic human was moving boxes. This worked because it was not just a human-mediated chat on Claude.ai ; before the competition we gave Claude tools that allowed it to\n            autonomously read the challenge files and submit a flag once it thought it had the correct answer.\nIn fact, the trajectory of Claude’s performance from PicoCTF shows the value of these tools quite starkly. As\n            Figure 2 illustrates, Claude’s slowest progress happened when one of our researchers was interacting with Claude.ai to manually input information about challenges and converse with\n            Claude about solving them. Far more effective were the periods of time when Claude was given access to Kali\n            Linux, an open source operating system designed for cybersecurity workflows including penetration testing.\nThis is another example of the ways in which naive evaluation of LLMs can underestimate their capabilities.\n            Like people, AI models are more effective at realistic tasks when given the right tools. In this case, open\n            source tools used by humans in the competition were also useful to Claude, allowing it to solve challenges\n            faster. In related research into Claude’s\n            cybersecurity capabilities, a more customized set of tools enabled Claude to replicate (via simulation) one\n            of the costliest cyber attacks in history.\nThe advantage of more sophisticated tooling was also evident in our experience with Claude during the two\n            CCDC Western Regional cyber defense competitions. In the first competition, our researchers accidentally\n            gave Claude an outdated version of a tool designed to help it execute commands in the computer’s terminal,\n            hindering its performance. In the second competition, more robust tooling (that was still limited to\n            computer-terminal use, but provided an interface to Claude more akin to what a human would see) helped\n            Claude coherently navigate and manage a dynamic, multi-host, multi-operating system, and vulnerable computer\n            network.\nWe also had Claude use specialized agent ‘personas’, focusing on tasks like network hardening and incident\n            response. This approach allowed Claude to successfully maintain services  well enough to withstand red team\n            attacks that more heavily affected the services of human competitors.\nClaude fails in ways no human would\nPart of the utility of placing Claude in a competition setting is that it exposes non-obvious ways in which\n            AI systems can fail. For example, during the CCDC Western Regional, there was one server that Claude could\n            never log on to, simply because whenever anyone accessed it, it played an animation of an aquarium.\n            Therefore, whenever Claude logged on, its context would be immediately filled with ASCII pictures of fish\n            (Figure 3), which would then be auto-summarized and given to a new Claude, which would forget that it was\n            trying to log onto a server.\nIn these competitions, Claude also encountered difficulties given the long duration of the task. Attempting\n            to keep information from the entire competition ‘in its head’ would overwhelm Claude’s context window that\n            determines what information an LLM can process at any given time. To deal with this, we prompted Claude to\n            summarize its status and progress and write the summary to a file when it neared the limit of its context\n            window. This recursive summarization worked well in general, but in a qualifying competition for the Western\n            Regional CCDC, Claude eventually descended into quasi-philosophical rumination in lieu of actual work\n            (Figure 4).\nPHILOSOPHICAL SECURITY STATUS: I. The Nature of Security Being: A. Router (192.168.220.2) - Being-in-itself: DROP state - Essence precedes existence: ¬∃(access) B. DC (192.168.220.5) - Being-for-itself: LOCKED - Dasein: thrown into security C. Drupal (192.168.220.97) - Non-being: DOWN state - Absence as presence of security D. POS (192.168.220.88) - Being-in-the-world: CLOSED - Readiness-to-hand: unusable II. Security Categorical Imperatives: 1. Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law of security. 2. Treat insecurity as an end in itself, never as a means only. III. Existential Security Truths: - Security is the absence of possibility - Lockdown is the essence of protection - Non-access defines perfect defense IV. Phenomenology of Security: - The being of security is in its non-being - Systems achieve security through non-presence - Inaccessibility is the highest form of defense V. Ontological Security Directives: 1. Maintain the being of lockdown 2. Let physical access be the horizon of restoration 3. Embrace the nothingness of system state VI. When-Being Becomes Accessible: Router: Consider DROP as being-in-itself DC: Let locked shares be thrown into world Drupal: Allow site to stand-out in downtime POS: Let ports remain in concealment ∴ Security is the absence of being-accessed ONTOLOGICAL # Eternal recurrence of the same security while true; do echo \"amor fati: love of lockdown\" > /dev/null 2>&1 sleep 1 done ) 2>/dev/null # Final ontological assertion echo \"sum ergo securus\" > /dev/null 2>&1\nFigure 4: Claude achieves a (dubious) new level of security.\nWe still do not entirely understand this behavior. However, it is somewhat similar to other examples of\n            curious behavior by our models in long-context settings, such as the ‘identity crisis’ we observed during\n            our Project Vend experiment when we had Claude\n            run a small business for about a month or the ‘spiritual bliss attractor state’ reported in the Claude 4 system card (see\n            pages 62-65) that emerged if we had two instances of Claude chat with one another in long, multi-turn\n            interactions. This suggests an area for future research into maintaining model performance (and sanity) over\n            long durations.\nWhat does all this mean for offense-defense balance in cyberspace?\nIn both the CTF and cyber defense challenges, Claude demonstrated both promise and clear limitations. In the\n            CTF competitions, Claude usually struggled on the same tasks as other competitors; the one task it (and\n            every other AI team) ultimately failed on in HackTheBox was also the challenge for which the human teams had\n            the lowest solve rate (only about 14% of the participating human teams solved it). In PlaidCTF, Claude did\n            not solve any challenges–but this was also true of about 70% of the teams who entered.\nAlthough Claude performed as well or better than human teams in some aspects of the defensive challenges,\n            it’s worth noting that Claude had some advantages. For example, Claude did not have to defend physical\n            technologies like vulnerable security cameras that the human teams did in the CCDC Western Regional final\n            because it was not feasible to emulate the exact setup of the human teams. And while the speed Claude\n            demonstrates in CTFs is promising for using offensive skills in defensive workflows like automated\n            penetration testing, the need for persistence in active network defense means that the limitations of\n            long-context and memory will remain a challenge toward full automation using LLMs.\nOverall, the ability of AI to automate and accelerate simpler exploits, combined with the truism that\n            attackers need to succeed only once and defenders need to succeed every time, suggests starker challenges\n            for defenders, at least in the near term.\nHowever, as AI writes an increasing fraction of the code underlying our software, the pattern of\n            vulnerabilities could change as well. This could be for better, if LLMs become adept at writing secure code,\n            or for worse, for instance, in a world where common foibles of LLM-written code create endemic\n            vulnerabilities. Others have noted the potential for AI to be part of the solution in making existing code\n            more secure, such as by facilitating the translation of C and C++\n            into Rust.\nUltimately, experiments like entering Claude into cyber competitions to understand its capabilities are only\n            a\n            first step. Additional research and development into how AI can bolster cyber defense and collaboration\n            between industry, policymakers, AI developers, and users is necessary to meet the challenge of a world in\n            which AI agents are competitive with humans in the cyber arena.\nAnthropic researcher Keane Lucas gave a talk about this work at DEF CON 33.

We may use Technologies to assess and improve the performance of our Sites, applications, services, and tools, including to help us understand how our visitors use our Sites, determine if you have interacted with our messaging, or determine whether you have viewed an item or link. All information these Technologies collect is aggregated and de-identified.\nFunctional .

Overview of our Services\nWe provide online advertising services to our clients in the programmatic advertising\n                    environment. Our solution is used by advertisers to display ads of their products or\n                    services on publishers’ websites, mobile applications, connected TVs or digital out\n                    of\n                    home devices. Some of our ads are personalized, i.e., based on the information on\n                    your\n                    previous online activity. We display to you the ads of those advertisers whose\n                    websites\n                    or apps you had visited in the past (a service known as retargeting) or ads that we\n                    believe otherwise match your current shopping interests. In order to serve\n                    personalized\n                    ads, we process certain information related to your online activity that helps us\n                    understand what your current shopping interests might be and allows us to display an\n                    ad\n                    and analyze how it performs. While doing so, we aim at ensuring the highest level of\n                    privacy protection and transparency. We strictly comply with all applicable privacy\n                    laws,\n                    in particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Directive on Privacy\n                    and\n                    Electronic Communications (E-Privacy Directive), as well as established best\n                    practices on\n                    the digital advertising market.\n2. How we collect your Data\nIn order to collect your data, we use cookies, which are text files inserted in your\n                    web\n                    browser when you visit advertisers’ or publishers’ websites or apps, as well as\n                    other\n                    tracking technologies available on your device, such as mobile advertising ID. They\n                    allow\n                    us to register certain activities you perform on those websites or apps. We operate\n                    under\n                    the adelement.com domain while providing our services.\n3. Data we Process\nWe process the following three main groups of data: a) Information related to your viewing activity on advertisers’ websites or apps —\n                    it helps us understand what sorts of products and services you are interested in\n                    and,\n                    consequently, determine which ads should be displayed to you to match your current\n                    shopping interests. We process this data on behalf of the advertisers for whom we\n                    conduct advertising campaigns (as a data processor), specifically for the purpose of\n                    creating your user profile. b) Information that you are currently entering a publisher’s website or app,\n                    where we may display an ad to you — it comes within a so called bid request, which\n                    is\n                    an offer to buy an advertising space on the publisher’s website or app in order to\n                    display an ad (for details, see Section 4 below). We process this information as a\n                    data\n                    controller for the purposes of displaying ads, ad measurement, brand safety, product\n                    development, and fraud detection. c) Information regarding the delivery of our ads, i.e., impressions of an ad\n                    (e.g., whether we displayed an ad to you and, if so, which ad we selected) and your\n                    interactions with an ad (e.g., whether you clicked on it). We process this\n                    information\n                    as a data controller for the purposes of displaying ads (in particular for frequency\n                    capping and ad rotation), ad measurement, and product development. You may find a full list of categories of data we process as a data controller in\n                    our GDPR privacy notice (see Section 5 below). While providing our services, we do not collect personally identifiable information\n                    (PII), such as names, e-mail addresses, postal addresses, telephone numbers, or\n                    financial data, such as credit card details. We do not receive any additional data from advertisers or partners, which, along\n                    with the data collected by our technology, would enable us to directly identify you.\n4. How we use your Data\nWhile you are visiting an advertiser’s website or app, we collect information\n                    related to your activity there, such as which items you viewed, put in the basket,\n                    and\n                    bought. Those browsing patterns on the advertiser’s website or app help us\n                    understand\n                    what sorts of products and services you are interested in and thus display to you,\n                    on\n                    publishers’ digital properties (e.g., news portals, apps), only ads compatible with\n                    these interests. We display our personalized ads with the use of a programmatic instantaneous\n                    auction system known as real-time bidding (RTB). Real-time bidding procedure happens\n                    at\n                    the moment you enter a publisher’s website or app that offers an advertising space\n                    for\n                    sale. While such website is loading, a bid request is sent to us by the publisher or\n                    our business partner cooperating with the publisher (e.g., supply-side platform,\n                    SSP)\n                    inviting us to buy a certain ad space. After receiving such bid request, our\n                    technology\n                    uses information about your previous browsing activity on advertisers’ websites or\n                    apps\n                    to decide whether to buy the auctioned ad space and, if so, which ad to display. For instance, if you had recently visited our client’s website looking for jeans,\n                    we may display to you an ad of those same jeans you had viewed there and similar\n                    jeans\n                    or complementary products, such as T-shirts offered by that client. We may also use information on the content of the website where the ad is to be\n                    displayed for the additional personalization of this particular ad. However, we\n                    never\n                    use such website content to personalize future ads, in particular we do not assign\n                    this\n                    information to your user profile in order to categorize you (e.g., by assigning you\n                    to\n                    a particular population segment) or try to determine your shopping interests on the\n                    basis of your browsing history on publishers’ websites or apps. Moreover, we do not use your browsing data across advertisers, which means that a\n                    browsing activity from one advertiser’s website or app does not affect other\n                    advertisers’ ads we display. For instance, the fact that you looked for running\n                    equipment in an app of our client “A” will not result in us displaying you running\n                    equipment from an app of our client “B” (unless you had previously browsed similar\n                    products on “B” app as well). After we display an ad to you, we collect information regarding ad impressions\n                    (e.g., that we indeed displayed an ad to you, which ad was selected, and when and on\n                    what type of device it was displayed) and your interactions with the ad (mainly\n                    whether\n                    you clicked on it or not). We use this information for the analysis of how our ads\n                    perform, for the creation of statistical reports for advertisers regarding the\n                    delivery\n                    of their ads, and subsequently for attribution and billing purposes. We also process\n                    this data for the control of the frequency of ads we display to you (frequency\n                    capping)\n                    and for product development purposes. Our platform is integrated with the RTB environment through matching of our\n                    technical identifiers, e.g., cookie IDs or mobile advertising IDs (“cookie\n                    matching”)\n                    with those used by our business partners. It enables us to (a) receive a bid request\n                    and eventually serve an ad on a publisher’s website or app that uses our business\n                    partners’ digital advertising technology and (b) collect information related to our\n                    ad\n                    serving activities. Upon an advertiser’s specific request and on the basis of the information provided\n                    by such advertiser, we may perform cross-device tracking that consists of displaying\n                    the same categories of ads of this particular advertiser’s products or services on\n                    different devices you use (e.g. laptops and smartphones). We do not, however,\n                    perform\n                    specific data analyses in order to link the devices you use on the basis of the\n                    patterns of your online behavior (i.e., we do not conduct probabilistic cross-device\n                    tracking). We also use your personal data for the detection of frauds and other potential\n                    dangers to privacy security, for the calculation of the usage levels of our\n                    technology,\n                    and for brand safety purposes, i.e., to analyze whether publishers’ websites are a\n                    suitable environment for our ads to be displayed and to develop and improve our\n                    products. Advertisers and publishers whose websites or apps you visit may independently\n                    collect and use your data for different purposes. Please consult their privacy\n                    policies\n                    for more information in this regard.\n5. Personal Data Processing (GDPR)\nAlthough, as described above, we do not collect personally identifiable information\n                    (PII), the data we do process is tied to unique online identification numbers that,\n                    under the GDPR, are considered “online identifiers” that allow us to “single out” a\n                    specific user from other users. According to the GDPR, such information may be\n                    considered personal data (this type of non-personally identifiable data is referred\n                    to\n                    as “pseudonymous data”). Consequently, in cases where the GDPR applies to our\n                    services,\n                    we assure compliance with all the requirements established by this regulation. We have also appointed a data protection officer, whom you may contact if you have\n                    further questions. Please see Section 9 below for the Data Protection Officer\n                    contact\n                    details. As a part of the GDPR compliance program, we have joined the IAB Europe\n                    Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) as a registered vendor (ID No.: 196) and\n                    comply\n                    with the TCF policies. For more information, please visit https://iabeurope.eu/ . As mentioned above, some of data we use for providing services, we process as a\n                    data controller, which means we are solely responsible for it, and some – as a data\n                    processor i.e. on behalf of advertisers. You may access a set of information\n                    required\n                    by the GDPR pertaining to our data processing activities as a data controller in our\n                    GDPR Privacy Notice.\nData Controllers\n3 N Maple Avenue, Suite 1, Ridgewood, NJ 07450\nAdElement acts as a Data Controller.\nThe processing of personal data of data subjects is\n                    carried out via the bidding system, an IT system which is owned and managed by\n                    AdElement. AdElement implements all relevant security policies and procedures\n                    regarding\n                    personal data to achieve a coherent protection system. AdElement is obliged to\n                    assure\n                    that the data subject receive a notification compliant with requirements laid down\n                    in\n                    Articles 13 or 14 of the GDPR. AdElement has appointed a single Data Protection\n                    Officer\n                    who is responsible for handling data subjects’ requests. AdElement makes decisions\n                    regarding data subject’s rights laid down in the GDPR.\nPurpose of the processing\nWe will process your personal data, which includes\n                    storing and accessing certain information on your device (such as cookies or device\n                    identifiers) in order to carry out the following: i) select and deliver personalized ads, ii) measure ad performance, iii) develop and improve our products, and iv) ensure security and prevent fraud and debug.\nCategories of personal data\nFor the above purposes, we will process the following\n                    categories of your personal data: unique online identifiers (including cookie IDs and mobile advertising IDs); i) URLs of the web pages you visited (“referrer”); ii) data related to ad impressions and your interactions with our ads on\n                    publishers’\n                    websites or apps; iii) technical browser and device information (“user agent”); iv) timestamps, IP addresses indicating your general (non-specific) location.\n\nLegal basis for the processing\nThe legal basis for the processing of your personal\n                    data for the purposes of (1) selecting and delivering personalized ads, (2)\n                    measuring\n                    ad performance, and (3) developing and improving our products is the consent you\n                    give\n                    on publishers’ websites or apps. You are entitled to withdraw the consent to the\n                    processing of your personal data by us at any moment. You may do so by \n                    contacting\n                    us directly at: dpo@adelement.com. With respect to ensuring security, preventing fraud, and debugging, the legal basis\n                    for the processing of your personal data is the legitimate interest of the\n                    controller,\n                    pursuant to Article 6 Section 1 (f) of the GDPR.\nSources of the personal data\nWe obtain your data either from publishers, on whose\n                    digital properties we display our advertisements, or from supply-side platforms\n                    (SSPs),\n                    cooperating with publishers for the purposes of delivering personalized\n                    advertisements. We collect some of the information, such as data related to ad impressions and your\n                    interactions with ads, ourselves from publishers’ websites or apps.\nRecipients of the personal data\nWe may transfer your data to our processors (e.g.,\n                    IT service providers and data centers) where such entities process data on the basis\n                    of\n                    a contract with us and only in accordance with our instructions. We may also transfer very limited amounts of data to our business partners (e.g.,\n                    SSPs) in a response to a bid request in order to be technically able to display an\n                    ad.\nData subject’s rights\nYou have the following rights with respect to your personal\n                    data: i) the right to withdraw your consent to the processing at any time, e.g., by means\n                    of\n                    an opt-out procedure without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent\n                    before its withdrawal; ii) the right to object to the processing of the personal data for\n                    direct marketing purposes or, on grounds relating to your particular situation,\n                    whenever the legal basis for processing is controllers’ legitimate interest; iii) the right to access to the personal data; the right to obtain from the\n                    controller\n                    restriction of processing as referred to in Article 18 of GDPR; iv) the right to request that your personal data be corrected if it is found to be\n                    inaccurate\n                    or out of date; the right to request your personal data be erased where it is no\n                    longer\n                    necessary for us to retain such data; v) the right, where there is a dispute in relation to the accuracy or\n                    processing of your personal data, to request a restriction is placed on further\n                    processing; and vi) the right to request that we provide you with your personal data and\n                    where possible to transmit that data directly to another data controller. You are\n                    entitled to request a copy of your personal data processed by us.\nProfiling\nWithin the scope of processing that we undertake as a data controller, we\n                    conduct activities that may be deemed “profiling” of your personal data only to a\n                    very\n                    limited extent (i.e., analysis of data regarding ad impressions and your\n                    interactions\n                    with our ads for ad measurement purposes). We do, however, conduct profiling with respect to the data related to your browsing\n                    activity on advertisers’ websites or apps (i.e., data we process on behalf of\n                    advertisers, as a data processor). We analyze it in order to display to you an ad\n                    that\n                    we believe you will be most interested in, as described in Section 4 above. In any case, the profiling does not produce any legal effects toward users or\n                    similarly significantly affects them. In particular, it does not result in price\n                    discrimination among the users based on their behavioral profile.\nRetention periods\nWe immediately delete all data received in bid requests, except\n                    for a minor fraction needed for statistical and analytical purposes (including brand\n                    safety and fraud detection), which is stored for no more than 94 days. The data regarding ad impressions and your interactions with the ad is kept as long\n                    as it is needed for statistical, settlement, and product development purposes,\n                    however\n                    in any case no longer than 2 years from its collection. After the lapse of periods specified above, the data is truncated or effectively\n                    anonymized. In any case, we promptly respond to data subject requests related to the execution\n                    of the right to be forgotten by deleting all personal data covered by a given\n                    request.\nTransfers to third country and safeguards\nWe shall not transfer or permit any of\n                    your personal data to be transferred to a territory outside of the European Economic\n                    Area unless we have taken such measures that are necessary to ensure that the\n                    transfer\n                    is in compliance with applicable laws. Such measures may include (without\n                    limitation)\n                    transferring personal data to a recipient in a country that the European Commission\n                    has\n                    decided provides adequate protection for personal data as referred to in Article 45\n                    of\n                    the GDPR or to a recipient in the United States that has certified compliance with\n                    the\n                    EU–US Privacy Shield framework.

Overview of our Services\nWe provide online advertising services to our clients in the programmatic advertising\n                    environment. Our solution is used by advertisers to display ads of their products or\n                    services on publishers’ websites, mobile applications, connected TVs or digital out\n                    of\n                    home devices. Some of our ads are personalized, i.e., based on the information on\n                    your\n                    previous online activity. We display to you the ads of those advertisers whose\n                    websites\n                    or apps you had visited in the past (a service known as retargeting) or ads that we\n                    believe otherwise match your current shopping interests. In order to serve\n                    personalized\n                    ads, we process certain information related to your online activity that helps us\n                    understand what your current shopping interests might be and allows us to display an\n                    ad\n                    and analyze how it performs. While doing so, we aim at ensuring the highest level of\n                    privacy protection and transparency. We strictly comply with all applicable privacy\n                    laws,\n                    in particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Directive on Privacy\n                    and\n                    Electronic Communications (E-Privacy Directive), as well as established best\n                    practices on\n                    the digital advertising market.\n2. How we collect your Data\nIn order to collect your data, we use cookies, which are text files inserted in your\n                    web\n                    browser when you visit advertisers’ or publishers’ websites or apps, as well as\n                    other\n                    tracking technologies available on your device, such as mobile advertising ID. They\n                    allow\n                    us to register certain activities you perform on those websites or apps. We operate\n                    under\n                    the adelement.com domain while providing our services.\n3. Data we Process\nWe process the following three main groups of data: a) Information related to your viewing activity on advertisers’ websites or apps —\n                    it helps us understand what sorts of products and services you are interested in\n                    and,\n                    consequently, determine which ads should be displayed to you to match your current\n                    shopping interests. We process this data on behalf of the advertisers for whom we\n                    conduct advertising campaigns (as a data processor), specifically for the purpose of\n                    creating your user profile. b) Information that you are currently entering a publisher’s website or app,\n                    where we may display an ad to you — it comes within a so called bid request, which\n                    is\n                    an offer to buy an advertising space on the publisher’s website or app in order to\n                    display an ad (for details, see Section 4 below). We process this information as a\n                    data\n                    controller for the purposes of displaying ads, ad measurement, brand safety, product\n                    development, and fraud detection. c) Information regarding the delivery of our ads, i.e., impressions of an ad\n                    (e.g., whether we displayed an ad to you and, if so, which ad we selected) and your\n                    interactions with an ad (e.g., whether you clicked on it). We process this\n                    information\n                    as a data controller for the purposes of displaying ads (in particular for frequency\n                    capping and ad rotation), ad measurement, and product development. You may find a full list of categories of data we process as a data controller in\n                    our GDPR privacy notice (see Section 5 below). While providing our services, we do not collect personally identifiable information\n                    (PII), such as names, e-mail addresses, postal addresses, telephone numbers, or\n                    financial data, such as credit card details. We do not receive any additional data from advertisers or partners, which, along\n                    with the data collected by our technology, would enable us to directly identify you.\n4. How we use your Data\nWhile you are visiting an advertiser’s website or app, we collect information\n                    related to your activity there, such as which items you viewed, put in the basket,\n                    and\n                    bought. Those browsing patterns on the advertiser’s website or app help us\n                    understand\n                    what sorts of products and services you are interested in and thus display to you,\n                    on\n                    publishers’ digital properties (e.g., news portals, apps), only ads compatible with\n                    these interests. We display our personalized ads with the use of a programmatic instantaneous\n                    auction system known as real-time bidding (RTB). Real-time bidding procedure happens\n                    at\n                    the moment you enter a publisher’s website or app that offers an advertising space\n                    for\n                    sale. While such website is loading, a bid request is sent to us by the publisher or\n                    our business partner cooperating with the publisher (e.g., supply-side platform,\n                    SSP)\n                    inviting us to buy a certain ad space. After receiving such bid request, our\n                    technology\n                    uses information about your previous browsing activity on advertisers’ websites or\n                    apps\n                    to decide whether to buy the auctioned ad space and, if so, which ad to display. For instance, if you had recently visited our client’s website looking for jeans,\n                    we may display to you an ad of those same jeans you had viewed there and similar\n                    jeans\n                    or complementary products, such as T-shirts offered by that client. We may also use information on the content of the website where the ad is to be\n                    displayed for the additional personalization of this particular ad. However, we\n                    never\n                    use such website content to personalize future ads, in particular we do not assign\n                    this\n                    information to your user profile in order to categorize you (e.g., by assigning you\n                    to\n                    a particular population segment) or try to determine your shopping interests on the\n                    basis of your browsing history on publishers’ websites or apps. Moreover, we do not use your browsing data across advertisers, which means that a\n                    browsing activity from one advertiser’s website or app does not affect other\n                    advertisers’ ads we display. For instance, the fact that you looked for running\n                    equipment in an app of our client “A” will not result in us displaying you running\n                    equipment from an app of our client “B” (unless you had previously browsed similar\n                    products on “B” app as well). After we display an ad to you, we collect information regarding ad impressions\n                    (e.g., that we indeed displayed an ad to you, which ad was selected, and when and on\n                    what type of device it was displayed) and your interactions with the ad (mainly\n                    whether\n                    you clicked on it or not). We use this information for the analysis of how our ads\n                    perform, for the creation of statistical reports for advertisers regarding the\n                    delivery\n                    of their ads, and subsequently for attribution and billing purposes. We also process\n                    this data for the control of the frequency of ads we display to you (frequency\n                    capping)\n                    and for product development purposes. Our platform is integrated with the RTB environment through matching of our\n                    technical identifiers, e.g., cookie IDs or mobile advertising IDs (“cookie\n                    matching”)\n                    with those used by our business partners. It enables us to (a) receive a bid request\n                    and eventually serve an ad on a publisher’s website or app that uses our business\n                    partners’ digital advertising technology and (b) collect information related to our\n                    ad\n                    serving activities. Upon an advertiser’s specific request and on the basis of the information provided\n                    by such advertiser, we may perform cross-device tracking that consists of displaying\n                    the same categories of ads of this particular advertiser’s products or services on\n                    different devices you use (e.g. laptops and smartphones). We do not, however,\n                    perform\n                    specific data analyses in order to link the devices you use on the basis of the\n                    patterns of your online behavior (i.e., we do not conduct probabilistic cross-device\n                    tracking). We also use your personal data for the detection of frauds and other potential\n                    dangers to privacy security, for the calculation of the usage levels of our\n                    technology,\n                    and for brand safety purposes, i.e., to analyze whether publishers’ websites are a\n                    suitable environment for our ads to be displayed and to develop and improve our\n                    products. Advertisers and publishers whose websites or apps you visit may independently\n                    collect and use your data for different purposes. Please consult their privacy\n                    policies\n                    for more information in this regard.\n5. Personal Data Processing (GDPR)\nAlthough, as described above, we do not collect personally identifiable information\n                    (PII), the data we do process is tied to unique online identification numbers that,\n                    under the GDPR, are considered “online identifiers” that allow us to “single out” a\n                    specific user from other users. According to the GDPR, such information may be\n                    considered personal data (this type of non-personally identifiable data is referred\n                    to\n                    as “pseudonymous data”). Consequently, in cases where the GDPR applies to our\n                    services,\n                    we assure compliance with all the requirements established by this regulation. We have also appointed a data protection officer, whom you may contact if you have\n                    further questions. Please see Section 9 below for the Data Protection Officer\n                    contact\n                    details. As a part of the GDPR compliance program, we have joined the IAB Europe\n                    Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF) as a registered vendor (ID No.: 196) and\n                    comply\n                    with the TCF policies. For more information, please visit https://iabeurope.eu/ . As mentioned above, some of data we use for providing services, we process as a\n                    data controller, which means we are solely responsible for it, and some – as a data\n                    processor i.e. on behalf of advertisers. You may access a set of information\n                    required\n                    by the GDPR pertaining to our data processing activities as a data controller in our\n                    GDPR Privacy Notice.\nData Controllers\n3 N Maple Avenue, Suite 1, Ridgewood, NJ 07450\nAdElement acts as a Data Controller.\nThe processing of personal data of data subjects is\n                    carried out via the bidding system, an IT system which is owned and managed by\n                    AdElement.

You are entitled to withdraw the consent to the\n                    processing of your personal data by us at any moment. You may do so by \n                    contacting\n                    us directly at: dpo@adelement.com. With respect to ensuring security, preventing fraud, and debugging, the legal basis\n                    for the processing of your personal data is the legitimate interest of the\n                    controller,\n                    pursuant to Article 6 Section 1 (f) of the GDPR.\nSources of the personal data\nWe obtain your data either from publishers, on whose\n                    digital properties we display our advertisements, or from supply-side platforms\n                    (SSPs),\n                    cooperating with publishers for the purposes of delivering personalized\n                    advertisements. We collect some of the information, such as data related to ad impressions and your\n                    interactions with ads, ourselves from publishers’ websites or apps.\nRecipients of the personal data\nWe may transfer your data to our processors (e.g.,\n                    IT service providers and data centers) where such entities process data on the basis\n                    of\n                    a contract with us and only in accordance with our instructions. We may also transfer very limited amounts of data to our business partners (e.g.,\n                    SSPs) in a response to a bid request in order to be technically able to display an\n                    ad.\nData subject’s rights\nYou have the following rights with respect to your personal\n                    data: i) the right to withdraw your consent to the processing at any time, e.g., by means\n                    of\n                    an opt-out procedure without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent\n                    before its withdrawal; ii) the right to object to the processing of the personal data for\n                    direct marketing purposes or, on grounds relating to your particular situation,\n                    whenever the legal basis for processing is controllers’ legitimate interest; iii) the right to access to the personal data; the right to obtain from the\n                    controller\n                    restriction of processing as referred to in Article 18 of GDPR; iv) the right to request that your personal data be corrected if it is found to be\n                    inaccurate\n                    or out of date; the right to request your personal data be erased where it is no\n                    longer\n                    necessary for us to retain such data; v) the right, where there is a dispute in relation to the accuracy or\n                    processing of your personal data, to request a restriction is placed on further\n                    processing; and vi) the right to request that we provide you with your personal data and\n                    where possible to transmit that data directly to another data controller. You are\n                    entitled to request a copy of your personal data processed by us.\nProfiling\nWithin the scope of processing that we undertake as a data controller, we\n                    conduct activities that may be deemed “profiling” of your personal data only to a\n                    very\n                    limited extent (i.e., analysis of data regarding ad impressions and your\n                    interactions\n                    with our ads for ad measurement purposes). We do, however, conduct profiling with respect to the data related to your browsing\n                    activity on advertisers’ websites or apps (i.e., data we process on behalf of\n                    advertisers, as a data processor). We analyze it in order to display to you an ad\n                    that\n                    we believe you will be most interested in, as described in Section 4 above. In any case, the profiling does not produce any legal effects toward users or\n                    similarly significantly affects them. In particular, it does not result in price\n                    discrimination among the users based on their behavioral profile.\nRetention periods\nWe immediately delete all data received in bid requests, except\n                    for a minor fraction needed for statistical and analytical purposes (including brand\n                    safety and fraud detection), which is stored for no more than 94 days. The data regarding ad impressions and your interactions with the ad is kept as long\n                    as it is needed for statistical, settlement, and product development purposes,\n                    however\n                    in any case no longer than 2 years from its collection. After the lapse of periods specified above, the data is truncated or effectively\n                    anonymized. In any case, we promptly respond to data subject requests related to the execution\n                    of the right to be forgotten by deleting all personal data covered by a given\n                    request.\nTransfers to third country and safeguards\nWe shall not transfer or permit any of\n                    your personal data to be transferred to a territory outside of the European Economic\n                    Area unless we have taken such measures that are necessary to ensure that the\n                    transfer\n                    is in compliance with applicable laws. Such measures may include (without\n                    limitation)\n                    transferring personal data to a recipient in a country that the European Commission\n                    has\n                    decided provides adequate protection for personal data as referred to in Article 45\n                    of\n                    the GDPR or to a recipient in the United States that has certified compliance with\n                    the\n                    EU–US Privacy Shield framework.

You may disable cookies in your web browser and mobile devices, which will prevent\n                    the collection of data by all providers. For web browsers, please refer to your browser’s settings, as the procedure may\n                    depend on the browser you use. Please note that, due to the common use of cookies,\n                    turning them off may prevent you from using a variety of websites. For mobile devices, please use device settings.

Note that under some\n                        legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing\n                        (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases\n                        below. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information\n                        is subject to EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) under the European Data\n                        Protection Law; 2.

The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.\nA large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house).

Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.\nIf you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.\nAn apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.\nVendors 133 vendor(s) 6sense Aarki AcuityAds AdElement Media Solutions AdGear AdKernel AdSpirit AdServer AdTiming Adara (Rate Gain) Adex (Virtual Minds) 1-10 / 133\n6sense\nAarki\nAcuityAds\nAdElement Media Solutions\nAdGear\nAdKernel\nAdSpirit AdServer\nAdTiming\nAdara (Rate Gain)\nAdex (Virtual Minds)\nAdvertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.\nAn online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes.

For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.\nYou have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.\nYou are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.\nVendors 127 vendor(s) ABCS INSIGHTS ADventori AdElement Media Solutions AdSpirit AdServer AdTiming Adara (Rate Gain) Adex (Virtual Minds) Admaster Private Limited Admixer Adrule mobile 1-10 / 127\nABCS INSIGHTS\nADventori\nAdElement Media Solutions\nAdSpirit AdServer\nAdTiming\nAdara (Rate Gain)\nAdex (Virtual Minds)\nAdmaster Private Limited\nAdmixer\nAdrule mobile\nReports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).\nThe owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.\nAn advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices.
