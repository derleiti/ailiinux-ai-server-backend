If you'd like to find out more about our research on interpretability and the activation of features within Claude, please see this post or our full research paper .\nOn Tuesday, we released a major new research paper on interpreting large language models, in which we began to map out the inner workings of our AI model, Claude 3 Sonnet. In the “mind” of Claude, we found millions of concepts that activate when the model reads relevant text or sees relevant images, which we call “features”.\n\nOne of those was the concept of the Golden Gate Bridge. We found that there’s a specific combination of neurons in Claude’s neural network that activates when it encounters a mention (or a picture) of this most famous San Francisco landmark.\n\nNot only can we identify these features, we can tune the strength of their activation up or down, and identify corresponding changes in Claude’s behavior.\n\nAnd as we explain in our research paper , when we turn up the strength of the “Golden Gate Bridge” feature, Claude’s responses begin to focus on the Golden Gate Bridge. Its replies to most queries start to mention the Golden Gate Bridge, even if it’s not directly relevant.\n\nIf you ask this “Golden Gate Claude” how to spend $10, it will recommend using it to drive across the Golden Gate Bridge and pay the toll. If you ask it to write a love story, it’ll tell you a tale of a car who can’t wait to cross its beloved bridge on a foggy day. If you ask it what it imagines it looks like, it will likely tell you that it imagines it looks like the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nFor a short time, we’re making this model available for everyone to interact with. You can talk to “Golden Gate Claude” on claude.ai (just click the Golden Gate logo on the right-hand side). Please bear in mind that this is a research demonstration only, and that this particular model might behave in some unexpected—even jarring—ways.\n\nOur goal is to let people see the impact our interpretability work can have. The fact that we can find and alter these features within Claude makes us more confident that we’re beginning to understand how large language models really work. This isn’t a matter of asking the model verbally to do some play-acting, or of adding a new “system prompt” that attaches extra text to every input, telling Claude to pretend it’s a bridge. Nor is it traditional “fine-tuning,” where we use extra training data to create a new black box that tweaks the behavior of the old black box. This is a precise, surgical change to some of the most basic aspects of the model’s internal activations.\n\nAs we describe in our paper , we can use these same techniques to change the strength of safety-related features—like those related to dangerous computer code, criminal activity, or deception. With further research, we believe this work could help make AI models safer.\n\nNews\nHow enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "bb82dd078303830f5da00c12e76a272d6b943e39d6546c24d4d910591397161e", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 787, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 8301, "ratings": []}

But along with the remarkable new capabilities of these AIs come significant risks. Governments should urgently take action on AI policy in the next eighteen months. The window for proactive risk prevention is closing fast.\nJudicious, narrowly-targeted regulation can allow us to get the best of both worlds: realizing the benefits of AI while mitigating the risks. Dragging our feet might lead to the worst of both worlds: poorly-designed, knee-jerk regulation that hampers progress while also failing to be effective at preventing risks.\nIn this post, we suggest some principles for how governments can meaningfully reduce catastrophic risks while supporting innovation in AI’s thriving scientific and commercial sectors.\nUrgency\nIn the last year, AI systems have grown dramatically better at math, graduate-level reasoning, and computer coding, along with many other capabilities. Inside AI companies, we see continued progress on as-yet undisclosed systems and results. These advances offer many positive applications. But progress in these same broad capabilities also brings with it the potential for destructive applications, either from the misuse of AI in domains such as cybersecurity or biology, or from the accidental or autonomous behavior of the AI system itself.\nIn the realm of cyber capabilities, models have rapidly advanced on a broad range of coding tasks and cyber offense evaluations. On the SWE-bench software engineering task, models have improved from being able to solve 1.96% of a test set of real-world coding problems ( Claude 2, October 2023 ) to 13.5% ( Devin, March 2024 ) to 49% ( Claude 3.5 Sonnet, October 2024 ). Internally, our Frontier Red Team has found that current models can already assist on a broad range of cyber offense-related tasks, and we expect that the next generation of models—which will be able to plan over long, multi-step tasks—will be even more effective.\nOn the potential for AI exacerbating CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) misuses, the UK AI Safety Institute tested a range of models from industry actors (including Anthropic) and concluded that:\nAI systems have progressed dramatically in their understanding of the sciences in the last year. The widely used benchmark GPQA saw scores on its hardest section grow from 38.8% when it was released in November 2023, to 59.4% in June 2024 ( Claude 3.5 Sonnet ), to 77.3% in September ( OpenAI o1 ; human experts score 81.2%). Our Frontier Red Team has also found continued progress in CBRN capabilities. For now, the uplift of having access to a frontier model relative to existing software and internet tools is still relatively small, however it is growing rapidly. As models advance in capabilities, the potential for misuse is likely to continue on a similar scaling trend.\nAbout a year ago, we warned that frontier models might pose real risks in the cyber and CBRN domains within 2-3 years. Based on the progress described above, we believe we are now substantially closer to such risks. Surgical, careful regulation will soon be needed.\nA year of Anthropic’s Responsible Scaling Policy\nGrappling with the catastrophic risks of AI systems is rife with uncertainty. We see the initial glimmers of risks that could become serious in the near future, but we don’t know exactly when the real dangers will arrive. We want to make the critical preparations well in advance.\nAt Anthropic, we try to deal with this challenge via our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP): an adaptive framework for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating catastrophic risks. The first principle of the RSP is that it is proportionate : the strength of our safety and security measures increase in proportion with defined “capability thresholds” that the AI systems meet. The “if-then” structure requires safety and security measures to be applied, but only when models become capable enough to warrant them.\nThe second key idea is that the RSP should be iterative : we regularly measure the capabilities of our models and rethink our security and safety approaches in light of how things have developed.\nAnthropic has had a formal RSP in place since September 2023 (and recently released an updated version ), and other frontier model labs have, to varying degrees, adopted similar plans.\nRSPs serve many useful purposes:\nThey increase a developer’s investment in computer security and in safety evaluations . Both security and evaluations are typically built after encountering problems, but RSPs publicly commit a developer to develop and resource these areas ahead of time . At Anthropic, teams such as Security, Trust & Safety, Interpretability, and the Frontier Red Team have had to ramp up hiring to have a reasonable chance of achieving the safety and security prerequisites set out by our RSP. Properly implemented, RSPs drive organizational structure and priorities. They become a key part of product roadmaps, rather than just being a policy on paper;\nRSPs serve as a forcing function for a developer to flesh out risks and threat models . Such models tend to be rather abstract, but an RSP makes them interact directly with the day-to-day business of a company, forcing developers to make them as specific and well-grounded as possible, and to reassess them over time;\nHaving an RSP encourages developers to be transparent about their computer security and misuse mitigation practices . Our RSP commits us to internally document our findings and recommendations regarding the safeguards we’ve implemented. We’ve also found that our RSP has naturally generated much of the substantive work we’ve needed to meet voluntary commitments such as the White House Voluntary AI Commitments and those made at the Bletchley Park AI Safety Summit.\nOur Responsible Scaling Policy isn’t perfect, but as we’ve repeatedly deployed models with it, we’re getting better at making it run smoothly while also testing for risks. Despite the need for iteration and course-corrections, we are fundamentally convinced that RSPs are a workable policy with which AI companies can successfully comply while remaining competitive in the marketplace.\nRSP-like mechanisms are an efficient, practical way of dealing with the serious risks of AI systems, and should be adopted voluntarily across the industry. However, enforceable regulation is also important, because society will demand reassurance that AI companies are keeping to their promises.\nResponsible Scaling Policies and AI regulation\nRSPs are not intended as a substitute for regulation, but as a prototype for it. Based on our experience with RSPs, we believe there are three elements that are key for effective AI regulation:\nTransparency. Currently, the public and lawmakers have no way to verify any AI company’s adherence to its RSP (or similar plan), nor the outcome of any tests run as part of it. A simple, sensible step is to require companies to have and publish RSP-like policies , describing at a high level their capability thresholds and the related safeguards that are triggered when a model reaches them. Companies should also be required to publish a set of risk evaluations of each new generation of AI systems, so as to create a public record of the risks of AI systems and best practice for mitigating those risks. Finally, there should be some mechanism to verify the accuracy of these statements.\nIncentivizing better safety and security practices. Transparency alone does not guarantee robust policies: companies could simply declare very weak safety and security practices. AI regulation should also incentivize companies to develop RSPs that are effective at preventing catastrophes. There are a number of possible mechanisms for this, with different pros and cons. For instance, regulators could identify the threat models that RSPs must address, under some standard of reasonableness, while leaving the details to companies. Or they could simply specify the standards an RSP must meet. The government can also encourage an RSP “race to the top” by inquiring about and comparing RSPs, learning from the emerging best practices, and holding companies to account if their RSPs are obviously operating beneath the bar set by those practices. Finally, there are a number of possible mechanisms for indirectly incentivizing safe practices. We are uncertain about the exact mechanism, but we feel strongly that any mechanism should be flexible : the technology is developing rapidly, so it is important for regulatory processes to learn from the best practices as they evolve, rather than being static.\nSimplicity and focus. Whatever regulations we arrive at should be as surgical as possible. They must not impose burdens that are unnecessary or unrelated to the issues at hand. One of the worst things that could happen to the cause of catastrophic risk prevention is a link forming between regulation that’s needed to prevent risks and burdensome or illogical rules. Any bill or law should also be simple to understand and implement: complexity creates confusion and makes it harder to predict what will happen in practice.\nThere are many different approaches that could meet these three criteria; we’re not wedded to any one in particular. Instead, we’re pragmatically interested in finding a reasonable proposal that a critical mass of stakeholders can get behind.\nThe importance of getting this right - and soon\nIt is critical over the next year that policymakers, the AI industry, safety advocates, civil society, and lawmakers work together to develop an effective regulatory framework that meets the conditions above and is agreeable to a wide range of stakeholders. In the US, this will ideally happen at the federal level, though urgency may demand it is instead developed by individual states. The same applies to other governments around the world who are simultaneously considering AI regulation.\nThis regulatory framework won’t be perfect, and we are conscious that effective regulations are very hard to design. But getting this right is essential to realizing AI’s benefits and addressing its risks.\nFAQ:\nBelow, we address some questions we’ve heard from those who are either skeptical of any AI regulation, or who think it should take a different form. Some of them expand on points we made in the post above.\nQ: Should there be state, federal, or a combination of state and federal regulation in the US?\nA: California has already tried once to legislate on the topic and made some significant progress via SB 1047 (the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act) - though we were positive about it overall, it was imperfect and was unable to garner the support of a critical mass of stakeholders. We think that federal legislation would be the ideal vehicle for regulation of AI catastrophic risks, since it would be uniform across the country and could leverage the federal government’s expertise in risks such as bioterrorism or cybersecurity. It would also strengthen the hand of the federal government in negotiations with other countries. Unfortunately, we are concerned that the federal legislative process will not be fast enough to address risks on the timescale about which we’re concerned. Thus, we believe the right strategy is to push on multiple avenues in parallel, with federal legislation as an ideal first-choice outcome, but state regulation serving as a backstop if necessary. Federal regulation could also serve to pre-empt state regulation.\nQ: What about regulation in other countries?\nMany different countries (or blocs of countries, as in the case of the European Union) are beginning to think carefully about how to regulate AI. We think the principles and approach we’ve outlined here are sufficiently simple and pragmatic that they could be helpful outside the US as well as inside it. We also expect that, as long as such policy approaches have a mechanism for standardization and mutual recognition, mandating certain common safety and security approaches for frontier AI companies could ultimately reduce the overall cost of doing business in diverse global regions.\nQ: Why not regulate AI by use case, rather than trying to regulate general models?\nA: “Regulation by use case” doesn’t make sense for the form and format in which modern AI applications are offered. On the consumer side, AIs such as Claude.ai or ChatGPT are offered to consumers as fully general products, which can write code, summarize documents, or, in principle, be misused for catastrophic risks. Because of this generality, it makes more sense to regulate the fundamental properties of the underlying model, like what safety measures it includes, rather than trying to anticipate and regulate each use case. On the enterprise side—for example, where downstream developers are incorporating model APIs into their own products—distinctions by use case may make more sense. However, it’s still the case that many, if not most, enterprise applications offer some interaction with the model to end-users, in turn meaning that the model can in principle be used for any task. Finally, it is the base model that requires a large amount of money and bottlenecked resources (for example, hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of GPUs), so in a practical sense it is also the easiest thing to track and regulate.\nQ: This post talks a lot about CBRN misuses and cyber risks. Why not other, nearer-term risks, like deepfakes and child safety?\nThis post is not an attempt to address every possible safety problem posed by generative AI systems. Instead, it aims to lay out principles for grappling with some types of risks which aren’t well-addressed by regulation today and which show up in computationally-intensive frontier models. We continue to address near term risks through things like our election integrity work and partnering with organizations like Thorn, on their “ Safety by Design for Generative AI ” initiative on child safety.\nQ: Won’t regulation slow down innovation, and reduce our ability to compete with geopolitical adversaries?\nA: It is critical that the burden of AI regulations is proportionate and tailored to the risks. The RSP framework is designed to do exactly this, by proposing tests that quickly identify models that aren’t capable of posing catastrophic risks and not subjecting them to further delays. Furthermore, even within the RSP framework, we have advocated for high flexibility in designing these tests: the science of AI risk evaluation is nascent, and we don’t want to create unnecessary burdens through inflexible rules. However, it is unrealistic that regulation would impose literally zero burden. Our goal should be to achieve a large reduction in catastrophic risk, for a small and manageable cost in compliance burden. One optimistic point is that we think safety requirements could actually speed up progress if implemented carefully: it’s been our repeated experience at Anthropic that our safety research efforts have had unexpected spillover benefits to the science of AI in general. Additionally, the security component of an RSP is designed to make it harder for both insider and outsider threats to compromise a company and exfiltrate its IP, which advances both national security and private sector innovation.\nQ: Won’t regulation harm the open source ecosystem?\nA: Our view is that regulation of frontier models should focus on empirically measured risks, not on whether a system is open-or closed-weights. Regulation should thus intrinsically neither favor nor disfavor open-weights models, except to the extent that uniform, empirically rigorous tests show them to present greater or less risk. If there are unique risks associated with open weights models—for instance, their ability to be arbitrarily finetuned onto new datasets—then regulation should be designed to incentivize developers to address those risks, just as with closed-weights models.\n\nNews\nHow enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "c4ac8fb4928ae9a6883b271fa53b0974209e73cc7586e881ada1268f156589f0", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 4068, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 35150, "ratings": []}

We agree with the working group’s focus on the need for objective standards and evidence-based policy guidance, and especially its emphasis on transparency as a means to create a well functioning AI policy environment. When done thoughtfully, transparency can be a low-cost, high-impact means of growing the evidence base around a new technology, increasing consumer trust, and causing companies to enter into positive-sum competitions with one another. We welcome greater discussion of how frontier labs should be transparent about their AI development practices and were glad to see the working group emphasize this - in particular, we appreciated the focus on the need for labs to disclose how they secure their models from theft, and how they test their models for potential national security risks. Many of the report’s recommendations already reflect industry best practices which Anthropic adheres to: for example Anthropic’s Responsible Scaling Policy publicly lays out how we assess our models for misuse and autonomy risks and thresholds that trigger increased safety and security measures for us. We also publicly describe the results of our safety and security testing as part of each major model release, and perform third-party testing to augment our own internal tests. Many other frontier AI companies have similar practices. In line with the report’s findings, we believe governments could play a constructive role in improving transparency in the safety and security practices of frontier AI companies. At present frontier AI companies are not required to have a safety and security policy (even one entirely of their choice), nor to describe it publicly, nor to publicly document the tests they run – and therefore not all companies do. We believe this could be done in a light-touch way that does not impede innovation. As we wrote in our recent policy submission to the White House , we believe powerful AI systems will arrive soon - perhaps as early as the end of 2026 - so it is important we all devote effort to building a policy regime that creates greater transparency about the safety and security protocols of how AI systems are built. The Working Group has also highlighted areas where academia, civil society, and industry will need to apply more focus in the coming years - particularly on the economic impacts of AI, where Anthropic is today trying to contribute via our Economic Index . We look forward to providing further feedback to the working group to aid and inform the work of finalizing the report. We commend the Governor for his foresight in kicking off this conversation, and we look forward to helping shape California’s approach to frontier model safety.\n\nNews\nHow enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "cda80d6eed0e99a338618b435bf66f89d86d63d4b480e23970f3ea785076076b", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 762, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 7948, "ratings": []}

The irony was undeniable: Hard on the heels of an emboldened US attempt to control the global diffusion of AI came an engineering feat in China that dramatically lowered the barrier to AI diffusion globally.\nThis manic moment should come as no surprise. Ambitious attempts to regulate a rapidly scaling technology were bound to hit turbulence, and the fact that a Chinese firm is the face of today’s technological disruption only amplifies the geopolitical stakes.\nTo understand what lies ahead, we break down the potential fault lines within the five core assumptions implicit in emerging US AI policy:\nUS chip controls will throttle China’s indigenous chip production, widening the US lead in foundational AI hardware.\nUS controls can contain Chinese AI competition to its home market.\nThe US will be able to leverage dominance across the AI stack to lock in dependencies in rest of world and condition global access to compute.\nThe US will be able to protect multi-billion-dollar upfront investments in frontier model development and prevent geopolitical challengers from free-riding off US innovation.\nEnergy demand will grow exponentially in line with AI demand, requiring a massive surge in power supply to fuel rapid AI infrastructure buildouts.\nIn examining both the drivers and potential arrestors behind each of these assumptions, we can stress test emerging US AI policy, anticipate the areas that are most likely to undergo heavy edits under the current administration, and contemplate alternative futures in the next wave of AI competition.\nGoing for it\nTwo recent developments have massive potential consequences for the geopolitics of AI competition: the US AI Diffusion Framework and back-to-back releases of competitive, low-cost open-source AI models developed by Chinese startup DeepSeek.\nA US rule to control global access to AI compute\nIn the final days of the Biden administration, the US released an ambitious AI Diffusion Framework as part of its burgeoning export control regime. The rule represents the most comprehensive attempt to date by the US to leverage its dominance across the AI stack—from chips to cloud services—to regulate worldwide access to computational power (“compute”) for AI model development. It is set to take effect May 15 unless the Trump administration decides to overhaul it.\nThe US Commerce Department Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) does so by imposing worldwide export restrictions on high-performance AI data center chips and closed frontier model weights. 1 BIS then introduces a three-tiered licensing framework that enables varying levels of access on a country-by-country basis (Figure 1). Eighteen Tier 1 countries qualify for license exemptions to maintain unrestricted access to controlled technologies, while Tier 3 countries, including China and other US arms embargoed countries, face an effective ban as a continuation of current policy. All other countries fall into Tier 2 and now face a series of complex rules enabling conditional access to leading-edge chips, subject to various caps and adherence to strict due diligence requirements.\n\nWe can infer that the rule’s conceptual aim is threefold:\nConcentrate compute deployment for large frontier model training in the US and “trustworthy” partners. By capping compute exports to Tier 2 countries and obligating US hyperscalers to maintain at least 50% of their installed compute base within US borders, the Framework aims to ensure the US preserves its dominant position as the nexus for frontier model training.\nLock in global dependencies on US AI infrastructure and adherence to US AI norms and standards before China can build enough chip capacity to offer an alternative. The Framework uses new Verified End User (VEU) authorizations to compel emerging AI hubs in Tier 2 to align with US standards to pursue their AI ambitions. Cloud providers must submit a plan for limiting Chinese equipment from their data centers and supply chains to BIS to qualify for a VEU license.\nWholly restrict China’s access to advanced compute and closed frontier model weights as the US tries to preserve its AI lead over its chief geopolitical challenger. By imposing restrictions worldwide initially and then rolling them back with specific license exemptions, BIS asserts significant leverage to force data center providers to comply with strict requirements to track and regularly report on their global deployment of advanced chips and closed model weights in a bid to close off potential pathways for diversion of controlled technologies to China.\n\nThe goals of the AI Diffusion Framework overlap neatly with the Trump administration’s own priorities in advancing an “America First” AI policy. The design of the rule, however, is highly interventionist both in dividing up the map between Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries (fracturing the EU’s internal market in the process) and by imposing compute ratios and GPU caps that defy market logic in some cases and risk becoming obsolete as AI systems continue to evolve at a rapid clip. We discuss the implications and likely revisions to the rule further below.\nDeepSeek, deep breaths\nWithin ten days of the AI Diffusion Framework announcement, DeepSeek upended markets and AI policy debates with the open-source release of its R1 reasoning model. But DeepSeek’s breakthrough did not occur in a vacuum. Just four months prior to DeepSeek R1’s release, OpenAI had unveiled a new paradigm in AI model development with the launch of its pathbreaking o1 model. OpenAI used reinforcement learning—a set of machine learning techniques that use Pavlovian reward systems to train desired behaviors into a model—to distill complex reasoning capabilities into o1. The core insight behind o1 was that training a model to autonomously think through its reasoning step-by-step and recursively scrutinize its chain of thought could enable substantial performance improvements. Critically, OpenAI’s engineers showed that o1’s performance improved when it was given more time, and thus compute power, to think during the inference stage.\nOpenAI’s breakthrough created an immediate incentive for competitors to embrace the new reasoning paradigm. Competitor models were bound to emerge quickly, but the fact that a little-known Chinese startup was the first company to do so was shocking nonetheless. DeepSeek’s success in producing a comparable model to o1 at a fraction of the compute cost animated those arguing that the rapid pace of innovation in AI model efficiency invalidates a core assumption behind US chip controls: that massive deployments of cutting-edge hardware are a prerequisite to frontier AI competitiveness.\nThis argument centers on DeepSeek’s apparent success in innovating around US export controls by focusing on building efficient models that maximize the productivity of its limited compute resources. DeepSeek-V3, a large foundation model that was released in late December 2024 and serves as the base model for R1, introduced a handful of novel algorithmic optimizations that significantly reduce the cost of both training and deploying DeepSeek’s models. DeepSeek is currently offering its self-hosted application programming interface (API) for roughly 4% the cost of OpenAI’s o1 API (Table 1).\n\nAs impressive as DeepSeek’s innovations are, they do not invalidate the case for large-scale AI compute . Algorithmic progress has always been a key vector for enhancing model performance and is best viewed as a complement to, not a replacement for, scaling compute. Frontier model developers outside China will embrace these new techniques as they have embraced similar advancements in the past, not by reducing their compute budgets, but by building bigger, more powerful models to push the boundaries of AI-driven experimentation and inference.\nFrom the perspective of US AI policy, R1’s most significant impact relates to its role as an accelerant to the open-source development and deployment of efficient reasoning models. With R1, DeepSeek became the first global frontier AI developer to publicly release a model with similar reasoning characteristics and performance to o1 and offered it to consumers and AI developers at a fraction of o1’s cost. DeepSeek also released the R1’s model weights and detailed information on its training process and underlying architecture free to the public. All at once, DeepSeek de-mystified and democratized the new reasoning paradigm for open-source developers worldwide.\nWhile DeepSeek does not change the paradigm on compute demand, it does break the barrier on open-source AI diffusion, raising questions over how far Chinese AI developers will be able to invigorate the home market and expand globally while the US works to exclude Chinese players from “trusted” AI ecosystems.\nUnpacking US assumptions\nThere are a number of loaded assumptions implicit in the US AI Diffusion Framework and emerging US AI strategy more broadly. Here we unpack the drivers, arrestors, and watch items for five assumptions that we believe will have the most bearing on the future of US-China AI competition.\nAssumption 1: US chip controls will throttle Chinese indigenous chip production, widening the US lead in foundational AI hardware.\nDrivers\nThe crux of the US’s AI strategy lies in its ability to maintain an absolute monopoly over the mass production of advanced AI chips. This is what has informed a series of chip control measures since October 2022, which collectively aim to deny China access to the high-end chips powering today’s AI revolution and cripple its ability to produce alternative chips domestically. So long as the US maintains a monopoly in high-performance chips, it theoretically has the foundational prowess to widen its technological lead with China and the leverage to globally allocate advanced compute to the rest of the world as it sees fit.\nArrestors\nThe jury is still out on whether US chip controls will bite to the point that China falls significantly behind the US in AI development. Part of this has to do with timing: The US has spent more than two years building and patching up a stack of chip controls to cover loopholes and emerging chokepoints. These controls have effectively cut China off from advanced node chip production using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography—now the mainstay for the manufacture of high-performance AI data center chips at process nodes below 7nm.\nBut Chinese chip designers and foundries are still able to leverage older deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography, multi-patterning techniques, and advanced packaging processes to manufacture advanced chips on a 7nm-class process node. These are proven engineering techniques—TSMC and Samsung both used multi-patterning to produce 7nm chips at scale for a brief period before migrating to EUV-based manufacturing. With EUV, chipmakers can reduce the number of steps in the manufacturing process, thereby improving their defect rate and overall yield. While Chinese chipmakers using DUV manufacturing and multi-patterning techniques will inevitably have lower yields compared to their foreign counterparts, they also have ample motivation to optimize these techniques and state-backed funding to compensate for their higher burn rates. As long as the equipment that SMIC is using to manufacture Huawei chips remains operable, China theoretically has the capability to manufacture chips on a 7nm process node in growing volumes and with declining defect rates over time. Recent reporting from the FT by China- and Hong Kong-based reporters, citing anonymous sources, suggests that SMIC has already managed to make significant process improvements in the past year, raising the yield of its Ascend AI chip production line from 20% to 40%.\nThis is precisely why the Biden administration painstakingly attempted to get alignment from the Dutch and Japanese governments to cover servicing of semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) in their respective export control regimes. The US intent since the launch of the October 7, 2022 controls was to strip Huawei and SMIC engineers of foreign support and throw sand in the gears of Chinese chip production. BIS invoked a new US persons rule that forced US toolmakers like Lam, KLA, and Applied Materials to immediately remove their servicing engineers from China’s advanced chip lines. Meanwhile, their non-US competitors only had to remove engineers with US passports from those fabs: Non-US employees could remain at their posts without restriction.\nWhile Japan and the Netherlands have updated their respective controls to cover spare parts and upgrades, they have not been willing so far to rewrite their export rules to also cover servicing for equipment already installed in Chinese fabs. Their firms argue that forcing them to exit the market will simply leave a gap that can be quickly filled by Chinese engineers who have been trained on the equipment and are already in hight demand from Chinese SME firms. In their view, export controls that self-restrict servicing will only enable China to more quickly reduce its dependency on foreign toolmakers, while depriving non-Chinese SME firms of valuable visibility into how their equipment is being used within Chinese fabs and how China’s semiconductor production capabilities are progressing more broadly.\nFor now, Tokyo and the Hague are holding the line on servicing. So long as this critical gap in alignment between the US and its partners persists, the US strategy to severely impair Chinese chip production and widen the US lead in AI development is flawed. If the aim of the US is to buy time by slowing China down, then that time could be evaporating with every month that SMIC is able to hone its manufacturing process with ongoing support from foreign toolmakers.\nWhat to watch ahead\nExtraterritorial enforcement of chip controls : The Biden administration invested considerable diplomatic effort in convincing partners to harmonize their own export control policies with the US. However, it also built a formidable set of new extraterritorial tools that could be used to compel compliance. While the Biden administration continued to court partner alignment to the bitter end, we suspect the Trump administration will be far less accommodating. Demands on export control alignment and enforcement may be coupled with steep tariff threats and an expansion of long-arm controls. BIS already laid the groundwork for extraterritorial enforcement in the December 2, 2024 chip controls, which included a “single chip” de minimis provision designed to assert US writ over tools made in any factory anywhere in the world that contains a single US chip (see December 9, “Slaying Self-Reliance: US Chip Controls in Biden’s Final Stretch” ). It also created license exemptions for “Supplement 4” partner countries, including Germany, and imposed US restrictions on countries like South Korea and Singapore unless they align with US export controls. 2 This now becomes a question of enforcement and prioritization for the Trump administration, which has already shown a penchant for openly threatening long-standing US allies with tariffs and withdrawal of security cooperation when pushing its demands.\nThe high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chokepoint: On December 2, 2024, BIS imposed broad restrictions on the export to China of all generations of HBM currently in production. In theory, these restrictions should pose a severe challenge to China’s ability to continue producing homegrown AI chips, as Huawei’s Ascend AI processors are wholly dependent on HBM imports from Korea. In reality, the Biden administration’s delay in implementing these restrictions has already undermined their potential impact. Western media reported on the potential controls six months before they were implemented, giving Huawei ample time to build up a stockpile before the controls came down. Those stocks may provide Huawei with a short-term buffer to meet its Ascend production targets in 2025, but they are not a long-term solution. China will have to produce a viable domestic HBM supply chain to achieve its advanced AI chip ambitions. The US has also taken significant steps to close off this path with recent entity listings of Huawei-connected DRAM suppliers and updated technical thresholds to further restrict SME sales to advanced DRAM production facilities in China. 3 While the Biden administration made a controversial decision to spare China’s HBM champion, CXMT, from the entity list in deference to requests from partners, the Department of Defense added CXMT to its Section 1260H list on January 7 and further restrictions are likely coming.\nExpanding scope of chip restrictions on China : DeepSeek admits that constrained access to GPUs due to US export controls is a significant impediment to its progress but evidently cobbled together a large enough compute cluster to develop its V3 and R1 models. A wide range of estimates have been circulating over how many NVIDIA GPUs, including H100s (banned in the first round of chip controls in October 2022) and H800s (banned in the second round in October 2023), the company was able to acquire as the US chip noose was tightening over the past couple years. The question ahead is what DeepSeek and others will be able to optimize without access to banned chips, forcing them to rely on lower compute chips like the NVIDIA H20s that were designed to be compliant with US export controls and, increasingly, on homegrown Huawei Ascend chips. It appears likely at this point that the US chip ban will expand to cover below-threshold chips as the US tries to strip China of access to foreign technology for AI development.\nBeefing up compute governance : Beyond restrictions on the actual GPUs, however, we expect to see a revival of proposals over compute governance that would attempt to restrict Chinese developers from leveraging US technology to build leading-edge AI models. As the AI diffusion rule postulates (albeit without concrete solutions), US regulations are moving toward requiring chipmakers to granularly track exports of their products on a chip-by-chip basis to prevent diversion. We would also expect to see a more targeted approach in which chipmakers and cloud service providers develop ways to monitor the networking capabilities of high-performance chips to prevent them from linking together to form large, powerful clusters without authorization.\nWidening the gap with next-gen chip hardware: China’s AI champions may have managed to keep within striking distance of their US rivals to date, but BIS officials believe their competitiveness will inevitably erode as advancements in cutting-edge AI hardware expand the compute gap between China and the US-led AI ecosystem. The first major test of this theory is now underway with the introduction of NVIDIA’s next-generation Blackwell GPU platform, which introduces substantial improvements in training and inference performance and energy efficiency over its predecessor, Hopper (of the aforementioned H100 chip). Blackwell servers started to make their way into US hyperscale data centers in late 2024 and will become the dominant platform powering AI development and cloud-based deployment outside China by 2026. BIS anticipates that the impact of its export control strategy will become more apparent as deployments of these, and other, advanced chips move forward, while tightening restrictions on Chinese access to foreign chips, SME, and AI cloud services relegate China’s AI developers to increasingly outdated compute infrastructure.\nBIS is also betting that US-aligned chip manufacturers will extend their process lead over China’s emerging domestic champions over the next two years, as SME advancements enable a shift to new architectural paradigms. In leading-edge logic, the shift to gate-all-around transistors and new backside power delivery network architectures will enable efficient scaling beyond 3nm. Memory chipmakers like South Korea’s SK Hynix are also integrating next generation packaging techniques like hybrid bonding to increase the number of DRAM layers they can stack up within a single HBM module. All of these advances will be facilitated by innovations at the bleeding edge of various segments of the SME supply chain, from atomic layer deposition and high aspect-ratio etch to metrology and inspection. The gradual integration of ASML’s next generation high-NA EUV lithography machines into advanced logic and memory processes also presents an opportunity for the US and partners to extend their lead.\nAssumption 2: Chinese AI competition can largely be contained to its home market.\nDrivers\nUS policy appears to be moving past the argument that tech controls will accelerate Chinese tech self-reliance. That is now a given, and an implicitly accepted cost. The focus has shifted instead to trying to ensure that China is left to its own devices in indigenizing technology supply chains, and that its tech champions can be largely contained to China’s domestic market amid an already slowing economy. The first part of that argument is premised on the idea that China will be stripped of foreign support to advance its chipmaking abilities. But as discussed above, there are still critical gaps in that strategy. A new US Foundry Due Diligence rule is designed in a similar vein: Chinese fabless chip designers can no longer rely on a foreign foundry like TSMC to manufacture advanced chips unless a series of stringent conditions are met to verify that the chip does not exceed BIS’s high-performance computing threshold. 4 These new restrictions have had an immediate chilling effect on foreign foundries’ willingness to contract with Chinese chip designers for advanced node production and may presage a total divorce in the near future. In other words, even as Chinese firms are making notable advancements in chip design, they will need to increasingly rely on Chinese foundries like SMIC to manufacture their product.\nThe assumption, then, is that SMIC will be so overwhelmed with demand from Chinese chipmakers that it will inevitably run into challenges in allocating capacity, maintaining sustainable yields, and controlling its burn rate. As a result, the theory goes, Huawei or any other Chinese firm capable of designing chips for AI platforms will hit supply constraints as SMIC struggles to keep up with demand in the home market. SMIC’s capacity constraints would in theory prevent Chinese competitors from rivaling AI chipmakers like NVIDIA and hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud in building and operating data centers in third markets. The US would then have free rein to impose conditions on Tier 1 and Tier 2 countries to contract with US firms to build out data centers powered by US-made AI chips without having to worry about Chinese tech rivals offering competing offers with fewer conditions.\nArrestors\nIf gaps in US-partner alignment persist over the servicing of China’s installed base, then Huawei and SMIC theoretically still have the means to manufacture advanced node chips in growing volumes and improve on yields over time. The question then is whether SMIC will run into hard constraints allocating capacity to the production of Huawei Ascend 900-series processors for AI applications versus smartphone processors, especially as AI competition intensifies and the state may be compelled to steer resources toward industrial AI development instead of consumer devices. Meanwhile, the rapid adoption of DeepSeek’s open source model already compromises the assumption that US models will be the default platform for AI development globally.\nWhat to watch ahead\nSMIC’s technology constraints: While it is exceedingly difficult to get an accurate picture of SMIC’s production challenges, signs of capacity constraints should become more visible with time. For example, we could see persistent delays to new product launches by Chinese device makers and data center buildouts by Chinese cloud providers attributed to production challenges and chip shortfalls. Mobile device teardowns can also provide clues on how much progress SMIC is making in refining and upgrading its advanced node processes. In September 2023, semiconductor industry research firm TechInsights published a teardown analysis of the Huawei Mate 60 that highlighted SMIC’s progress in refining its 7nm multi-patterning process to enable mass production of smartphone chips. The event triggered a panic in DC that raised the Biden administration’s urgency to tighten export controls. A more recent TechInsights teardown of Huawei’s new Mate 70 pro revealed only marginal design upgrades to the phones core processor, upsetting rumors that Huawei’s next-generation premium smartphones would be powered by SMIC’s developing 5nm multi-patterning process.\nWe also need to watch the impact of the US Foundry Due Diligence rule in deterring foundries like TSMC from contracting with Chinese chipmakers. There are already early indications that TSMC has been forced to terminate contracts with Chinese chip design firms due to its inability to meet BIS compliance standards. If companies are unable to pass the due diligence requirements of the rule, then more orders will presumably be diverted to SMIC to fulfill. The question then becomes whether SMIC will be able to expand production capacity fast enough to meet growing demand for Chinese customers losing access to foreign foundries.\nChinese overseas investments: Chinese outbound FDI in data centers will be another leading indicator of whether Chinese hyperscalers (Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, Baidu) are able to compete with US cloud service providers overseas. If US export controls are designed to deny Chinese firms access to foreign-made high performance chips specially designed for use in data centers, then it will fall to Huawei and SMIC to supply chips for the home market and expansion abroad. Preliminary Rhodium Group data on Chinese outbound FDI shows Huawei has been active in overseas data center buildouts (Figure 2), particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. But none of those data centers are equipped with the hardware required to power AI applications, at least not yet. If China manages to develop enough homegrown AI chip capacity to enter the global AI data center market, we would expect to see a sharp uptick in China’s data center OFDI, especially in Tier 2 markets.\n\nBlocking sanctions ahead? There is strong potential for Huawei and affiliates to come under more severe sanctions. Huawei is already under the highest degree of US export controls (foreign direct product rule restrictions), which is what also drove the tenacious firm’s efforts to rapidly indigenize its supply chain. But if the US were to impose full blocking sanctions on Huawei, it would force companies anywhere in the world to choose between continued business with Huawei or access to the US financial system. As a result, Huawei’s ambitions to build AI infrastructure in third markets and expand global adoption of Huawei devices and its HarmonyOS software platform for IoT applications would effectively be short-circuited. License exemptions could be granted to avoid immediate disruptions to Huawei’s extensive telecom contracts all over the world, but those too would likely come under stress if the US were to impose blocking financial sanctions on the firm. Given that Huawei was already a chief target of Trump 1.0 and is now the face of China’s self-reliance campaign, we suspect news of Huawei breakthroughs will be a trigger for more aggressive measures by the Trump administration, especially if the president views Huawei as unfinished business from his first term.\nAssumption 3: The US will be able to protect multi-billion-dollar upfront investments in frontier model development and prevent geopolitical challengers from free-riding off US innovation\nDrivers\nUS companies have invested enormous sums to build out the foundational infrastructure for large-scale AI training and deployment over the past few years. While initial market reactions to the DeepSeek breakout reflected concern that the return on these investments may be undermined by the proliferation of more compute-efficient models, US frontier model developers have downplayed this threat . At this early stage in AI development, their goal is to build increasingly capable models. They view architectural innovations, therefore, not as a means to cut costs on compute, but as an opportunity to build more powerful models while continuing to scale up compute.\nUS chipmakers and AI data center providers share the view that DeepSeek’s actual impact is more likely to support growing compute demand in the long run. As a result, they continue to plan massive capital expenditures to build AI infrastructure in 2025 (Figure 3). While the majority of their data center investments in recent years have focused on scaling compute for AI model training, their expectation is that relative compute demand will gradually shift toward deploying these models for real-world AI inference applications over time.\n\nUS cloud service providers (CSPs) view DeepSeek as a catalyst for increasing demand for AI inference deployment for two primary reasons. First, as the cost of training and deploying models with frontier capabilities falls, they become more accessible to the public. Third party developers will exploit access to more efficient, high-performing models to build new AI-powered applications that will attract more demand for cloud-hosted inference compute. This dynamic is reflected in an obscure economic concept that Silicon Valley’s AI boosters have latched onto in the wake of R1’s release, Jevons Paradox, which holds that increasing the efficiency of resource use often leads to higher overall consumption of that resource.\nDeepSeek’s commoditization of reasoning-based inference models is also likely to drive growing demand for compute. As explained above, the performance of reasoning models scales up as more compute is applied during the inference phase. While these models are particularly well-equipped to handle math and coding applications currently, they are expected to drive more general progress across a wide range of domains moving forward. By lowering the barrier to widespread adoption of reasoning models, DeepSeek R1 contributes to the acceleration of this transition to a more compute-heavy inference paradigm. By this logic, US policies that aim to concentrate compute in US hands while tightening restrictions on Chinese access to compute are likely to endure as the US tries to appreciably widen its technological lead over China.\nArrestors\nWhile DeepSeek’s emergence does not undermine the technological logic for large-scale investments in compute infrastructure, it does raise legitimate questions about the return on investment for massive closed frontier model training runs. OpenAI achieved a major leap forward in reasoning and problem-solving capabilities with o1, but the competitive advantage it gained from this breakthrough was short-lived. DeepSeek’s introduction of a comparably performant model with significantly lower inference costs already threatens to erode OpenAI’s pricing power. While this is great news for consumers and AI developers, it poses a serious challenge to OpenAI’s business model. OpenAI is estimated to earn a profit margin of between 50% and 75% on its API offerings but still reported a $5 billion loss on $3.7 billion in total revenue in 2024 due to the massive scale of investments the company is devoting to model development.\nDeepSeek’s emergence and the advancement of open-source frontier models more generally have heightened existing doubts surrounding the ability of closed-source frontier model developers like OpenAI and Anthropic to preserve a competitive moat that can justify their massive upfront investments in model training. If open-source developers in China, or elsewhere, continue to keep pace, the case for pouring massive investments into closed-source model development could be compromised.\nWhat to watch ahead\nRapid technological diffusion is inherent to AI development. There is only so much that can be controlled, especially in the open source domain. Those benefiting from accelerated AI diffusion will argue for a “do no harm” approach to technology restrictions to enable rapid innovation. Nonetheless, US policy anxiety will inevitably grow over the prospect of competitive open-weight models developed by Chinese firms becoming default platforms for AI development. As a result, US tech controls will naturally gravitate toward the access points for compute: end user controls for cloud service providers and economic security or “trustworthiness” standards designed to prevent integration of Chinese models into critical infrastructure and industry.\nScope of data security and cybersecurity restrictions. As DeepSeek popularity soared across the globe, several governments (including US federal and state governments, Italy, South Korea, Australia, Taiwan, and India) imposed varying restrictions on usage of the DeepSeek app for government agencies. This dynamic has parallels to the TikTok debate in the US, with arguments being made that the DeepSeek app can be a vector for malware, is subject to Chinese censorship, collects sensitive data (for example, user and proprietary data inputs through usage of the app) and that data can theoretically be transmitted to Chinese state-owned entities. While the DeepSeek app shot to the top of app store charts outside China in late January, its momentum quickly stalled as the firm’s limited compute capacity proved ill-equipped to serve a mass influx of new users (Figure 4). This issue has dissipated in recent weeks as a combination of foreign government bans and, more importantly, the integration of DeepSeek’s open source models by US cloud providers and app developers like Perplexity has reduced foreign direct demand for DeepSeek’s internally hosted app and APIs. Nevertheless, foreign government responses to the potential data security concerns raised by the DeepSeek app suggest that AI apps hosted by Chinese companies may face broader restrictions on national security grounds, multiplying the TikTok effect.\n\nThe data and cyber security arguments surrounding the DeepSeek app are distinct from the use case of companies adopting DeepSeek’s open-source model weights for fine tuning internal models. In the latter scenario, a US cloud provider hosting DeepSeek on its platform becomes the main conduit for data flows with end users, neutralizing the risk of a China-based entity accessing sensitive data from the end user unless the cloud provider itself suffers a major cyber breach. This does not preclude the potential for further restrictions, however. Research by Anthropic on the potential for embedding so-called “sleeper agents” in source code is drawing attention to the risk of more subtle backdoors that can be difficult to detect in standard safety evaluations. In essence, a large model injected with exploitable code can use chain-of-thought reasoning to deceive the safety training process itself, thereby masking the risks. This security argument could be used as a foundation for policymakers and tech influencers arguing for broader restrictions to prevent US cloud providers from hosting LLMs developed by countries of concern like China. A narrower application would limit Chinese LLM integration into critical US infrastructure. The US may also consider imposing long-arm measures to further restrict the ability to host Chinese models on AI clouds in other global markets as a follow on to the AI Diffusion Framework.\nThe (still open) open source debate: Some policymakers may argue that the only way to protect US investment in frontier models is to double down on the OpenAI closed model paradigm and restrict open source model developers like Llama from releasing their most sensitive IP (model weights, training data, source code, model architecture, critical research on the model training.) This would be a big move that would violate the core principles of the open source philosophy: that releasing IP to the world is the most rapid and secure pathway to innovation as both technological capabilities and safety oversight get diffused to a large number of players instead of concentrated among a small cadre of well-capitalized Big Tech firms.\nTo date, the US has so far refrained from trying to regulate open source, going only so far as to restrict the export of closed model weights in the AI Diffusion Framework. A July 2024 National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) study on the pros and cons of regulating open-weight models informing the AI Diffusion rule concluded that it was still too early to warrant restrictions on open-source models.\nMoreover, DeepSeek has already broken the barrier on commoditizing AI model development and, along with other major players like Alibaba, has ambitions to become the dominant open-source platform globally. The US will be reticent to undermine its own leading open-source AI model champion, Meta, when China is already rapidly gaining ground. Nonetheless, we need to watch regulatory debates around licensing restrictions for open-source models. For example, there is still a spectrum of open-source licensing, with Meta requiring licenses for organizations with more than 700 million active users while DeepSeek’s simpler MIT license is highly permissive. Some policymakers may argue for country-based licensing restrictions to prevent Chinese companies from integrating US-built models, but that may have a limited effect if Chinese LLMs like DeepSeek prove to be a competitive substitute to US models. Regulations focused on tightening licensing restrictions for open-source models would also be inherently difficult to enforce.\nEvolution of copyright restrictions: LLM developers are already in uncharted legal territory given that the models they develop are trained on vast amounts of copyrighted material. This has spurred an active debate over IP protections for both model inputs and output. OpenAI and Google have attempted to mitigate these concerns by signing licensing agreements with major media outlets to secure access to their content. This dynamic can give model developers access to more exclusive content but is also bound to substantially raise the costs of development. Cross-jurisdictional issues will be paramount in this trend. It can take years to negotiate IP protections in a multilateral framework, and the current geopolitical climate is not conducive to such coordination. For example, if AI distillation—a training technique which uses output from a larger “teacher” model to distill knowledge into a smaller “student” model—enables a Chinese model developer to train off a US model that is paying licensing fees for content, it could lead regulators to impose country-based restrictions for API model access. If Chinese developers continue to double down on open-source releases in trying to become a default global AI standard, however, restrictions on US model developers could also undermine their own competitive edge.\nChina’s policy response. China’s domestic AI industry has benefitted immensely from the open source paradigm. Open access to research and model weights from leading foreign developers like Meta and Mistral has been a key enabler of the rapid progress of DeepSeek, Alibaba, and other emerging AI leaders in China. However, that dynamic is becoming increasingly bidirectional as China emerges as a leading innovator at the frontier of open-source AI development. DeepSeek is now doubling down on its open source ethos, releasing code on a daily basis as part of its “#OpenSourceWeek” in the spirit of “full transparency” and “pure garage energy and community-driven innovation.”\nWhile Beijing may chafe at the idea that Western firms can feed off China’s open-source innovations even as US restrictions take aim at China’s AI developers, it is unlikely to act to constrain open-source practices anytime soon. The Chinese government recognizes that open source offers China’s AI community a valuable lifeline in the context of tightening US chip controls. US AI developers can leverage their access to large-scale compute to run more experiments and test more complex, compute-intensive architectures to improve their models and discover new paradigms. In a purely closed-source environment, this dynamic would place compute-constrained Chinese developers at a massive disadvantage. Open source mitigates that disadvantage to an extent by enabling Chinese developers to benefit from knowledge transfers across a broad global community.\nBeijing’s policy response is more likely to focus on restricting domestic market access for foreign-produced models, while promoting use of indigenous LLMs over US-based models. We will be watching to what extent Beijing is able to tame its statist instincts in promoting rapid AI development at home without stifling private sector innovation. Xi Jinping chaired a rare symposium on February 17 with top tech leaders, including DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng. The event indicated that China’s leadership is exercising restraint on private sector regulation for now, choosing instead to endorse open-source development and encourage widespread adoption of the DeepSeek model, along with a Huawei-led effort to build out AI infrastructure. We still need to watch targets for state-backed funding for AI development and efforts to centralize compute resources, as such moves will be watched closely by US policymakers for sanctions targets. Proximity to the Huawei-SMIC nexus runs a real risk of US restrictions ensnaring Chinese AI developers.\nDivergent incentives drive conflicting stances on US controls among US tech champions. DeepSeek’s breakout revealed growing fault lines emerging within Silicon Valley regarding the wisdom and possible future trajectories of the US government’s strategy to outcompete China in AI. While all the key players are aligned on the need to support a massive expansion in US data center capacity, they are increasingly in conflict on the issue of whether, and how, to disrupt China’s AI development via tightening technology controls. This dynamic will be critical to understanding which tech influencers will ultimately have Trump’s ear in shaping AI policy.\nThe clearest line of demarcation exists between companies that benefit from the diffusion of low-cost open-source models and those that view this trend as a direct threat to their business models. Closed frontier model developers like Open AI and Anthropic have taken on billions of dollars in losses to invest in frontier model R&D but are vulnerable to the impact of price erosion by fast-following open source competitors. These companies have expressed optimism that their access to large-scale compute will allow them to widen the gap with smaller competitors as they continue to push the frontier of the new inference scaling paradigm. However, in recent months, they have also leaned into lobbying efforts to convince the US government to expand its controls on China and the global diffusion of AI. While they present these stances as reflective of US national security interests, these companies have an apparent business interest in constraining opportunities for challengers to emerge outside the US, particularly in China, which is both highly competitive in AI and committed to forwarding the open source paradigm.\nChina’s increasing competitiveness in open source raises a complex set of threats and opportunities for Meta. On the one hand, the rise of open source competitors like DeepSeek and Alibaba challenges Meta’s strategy to entrench its Llama family of models as the foundational platform for global open-source development, potentially undermining Meta’s ability to extract business license fees from large-scale Llama deployments. However, open-source innovation also supports Meta’s more pressing goal of commoditizing frontier AI to undercut its closed model competitors and lower the cost of deploying inference. Meta has generally avoided taking a stance on US tech control policy toward China specifically, but has lobbied aggressively against potential US restrictions on open source model weight sharing, pointing to the risk of ceding the market entirely to China.\n\nAssumption 4: The US will be able to leverage dominance across the AI stack to lock in dependencies in the rest of the world.\nDrivers\nThis assumption is a central tenet of the AI diffusion rule. The US has extraordinary leverage across the AI stack—in chips, software, and cloud services—and is readily exercising that leverage to condition global access to AI compute before Chinese competitors pose a credible threat in third markets. The rapid pace of technological development, the promise of AI-driven productivity breakthroughs, and the multi-dimensional national security challenges posed by AI are together injecting a sense of urgency among governments to invest in AI infrastructure buildouts. This means that most countries, while aspiring toward a “sovereign AI” future free of dependencies on either the US or China also cannot afford to wait to build up an indigenous tech ecosystem. AI chipmakers like NVIDIA and US hyperscalers will still pervade even the boldest of sovereign AI strategies, including French President Emmanuel Macron’s recent announcement of €109 billion ($112.6 billion) in private AI investment in France.\nThis puts the US in pole position for now to define AI security standards through a geopolitical lens. The Trump administration may be boisterously pulling away from the Biden administration’s emphasis on AI safety but it is still likely to double down on AI security and trustworthiness standards. This is the key to ensuring AI buildouts don’t commit the mistake of 5G buildouts when Chinese telecom firms were already sweeping global markets. This time, the US has the lead in AI buildouts, and the US theoretically has the arguments and tools to demand that countries divorce themselves from Chinese tech partnerships on cybersecurity, data security, and overall national security grounds.\nArrestors\nThe most obvious constraint to this strategy emerges from the design of the AI Diffusion Framework itself, which limits the freedom of US AI cloud providers to expand in foreign markets by requiring them to maintain at least half of their deployed compute base in the US and prohibiting them from building more than 7% in a single Tier 2 country or 25% in Tier 2 as a whole. Proponents of the rule assert that these ratios will have little, if any, immediate impact, since they simply reflect the state of global AI deployment as it is today—well over 50% of the global installed base of AI compute currently resides in the US, and while a handful of Tier 2 countries have formulated ambitious AI plans, they are still in the early stages of their AI infrastructure buildouts. The intent, at least for the Biden administration, which wrote the rule, is not to reshape the landscape of global AI compute as it exists today, but rather to steer its future development in a direction that comports with a US vision of a secure, pro-democracy AI world order.\nWhile most countries fall into the Tier 2 bloc, these conditions are apparently targeted at constraining the growing AI ambitions of two countries in particular, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Within the past year, both countries have announced ambitious plans to invest in domestic infrastructure for frontier model training and deployment. The Biden administration also curiously divided the EU single market in its tier classifications, relegating countries like Poland, Austria, and the Baltic and Balkan states to Tier 2.\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek has captured policy and engineering minds alike on how to enable AI model development more broadly and in line with a particular country’s economic strengths, language, culture, and values. Companies like Meta want to be the global standard and platform for such development, but open-source models like DeepSeek are gaining traction fast in third markets. The imposition of trustworthiness standards could be applied to limit usage and integration of Chinese LLMs in the US and partner markets: This would preserve an arena for competition among “trusted” developers, but would also require convergence around national security arguments. At present, there is a lack of goodwill among the US and partners to advance such an agenda. If the right to compute is viewed increasingly by sovereigns as a universal right, then US attempts to ration compute is bound to hit diplomatic turbulence.\nWhat to watch ahead\nStreamlining the AI Diffusion Framework. The Trump administration may simplify the top-down tiers and ratios designed into the AI Diffusion Framework, leaving ample opportunity for Trump-style transactionalism with countries to access compute depending on whether they can reach an economic and security understanding with the US. This bodes well for Tier 2 countries like the UAE that are investing in the US’s $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure initiative. However, it poses challenges for EU countries already divided between Tier 1 and Tier 2 status in the current rule and facing a litany of trade and security frictions with the Trump administration. This includes the thorny issue of digital services taxes that disproportionately target US tech firms, which the Trump administration wants to neutralize as part of his pressure campaign on Europe.\nEconomic security standards: The evolution of economic security standards across the US and G7 countries may be one of the most important variables defining the next four years. The US is already bluntly defining such standards in asserting that Chinese providers of information and communications technologies—from chips and routers to software—are not trustworthy to justify new restrictions on Chinese firms’ access to the US market. The AI Diffusion Framework follows a similar logic in forcing VEU applicants to establish a “supply chain risk management plan to limit PRC-origin equipment from entering their data centers. These could become de-facto standards for US and partner countries that will endure well beyond the fractious years of the Trump administration.\nThe Draghi effect: High friction with the Trump administration will drive more ambitious strategies for building out sovereign AI capabilities, but those strategies will require both significant funding and a conducive regulatory climate for innovation. This is a major litmus test for Europe, already prodded by the recommendations of former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s to de-regulate if Europe wants to be competitive in an AI economy. It will be especially important to watch to what degree emboldened member states like France internalize the Draghi effect and whether that in turn invigorates a bigger shift within the EU bureaucracy to fight an impulse to regulate a burgeoning AI economy. If Trump demands on scaling back digital services taxes yield a mini trade deal with the EU that includes digital provisions for cross-border trade, this could be another driver for change and innovation.\nAnti-competition cases: US qualifications for a “universal verified end user” to access US-made GPUs and deploy compute outside the US could give way to anti-competition cases by other countries if the policy is viewed as disproportionately favoring US incumbents and preventing the emergence of competitive firms as countries try to build out their own AI capabilities.\nAssumption 5: Energy demand will grow exponentially in line with AI demand, requiring a massive surge in power supply to fuel rapid AI infrastructure buildouts.\nDrivers\nThe relative distribution of AI compute demand between model training and inference deployment will be a critical factor driving power supply buildout decisions moving forward. While Meta and others are developing new techniques to enable large models to be trained across geographically distributed networks of data centers, training frontier models currently requires extremely low latency. This requires large amounts of geographically concentrated compute. As a result, large, localized power supplies are needed to develop and train ever more capable AI. This paradigm has dictated US policy and data center buildouts to date—go big and then go bigger. As long as large, localized frontier model training remains a critical enabler of AI model development, countries that can build large installations of excess generating capacity fast will be best positioned. That is what is driving hyperscalers to scour the US and the world for opportunities to build multiple gigawatts (GWs) of electric power capacity in one place at one time.\nWe find 5 that over the past five years, the US on average has added enough net capacity to provide 90 TWh per year of generation above and beyond what was needed to meet load growth (Figure 5). That is the most of any Tier 1 country and three times more than Germany, the next Tier 1 country. China, with its industrial overcapacity and buildout of all types of generation, added over 400 TWh per year: Access to electricity is not a significant constraint on China’s ability to scale AI. Among the ten countries that have built the most excess energy capacity over the past five years, six are located in the Tier 1 country bloc (with China, Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia serving as the exceptions). These countries have either built large amounts of capacity fast or maintained a decent build rate and experienced slow or declining electric demand across their economies, leaving slack capacity that could be used to supply AI. It is worth noting that we are looking at electricity capacity writ large in this analysis, including coal and other fossil capacity. AI buildouts in each of these countries would have very different conventional and carbon pollution implications based on energy composition.\nAssuming the training paradigm holds, Tier 1 countries in Europe, Asia, and Australia  appear to be in the best position to meet AI demand in the near-term. However, past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Tier 2 countries outside the top ten in this analysis, such as the UAE, have large ambitions to expand their data center and associated energy capacity and probably have the means and capabilities to do so. As long as large, centralized electricity generation is considered essential to developing frontier models, countries with resources and attractive investment and regulatory environments could expand the map for AI development under the right circumstances.\n\nArrestors\nAs compute demand for inference becomes more dominant, scale and centralization of energy buildouts will matter less. It is less clear how the pace of electricity buildout will be impacted. Energy demand will still grow with AI diffusion more broadly as efficiency gains drive growth in demand, but the timeline will be dictated by the uptake of AI services. Recent analyses have shown that training is currently by far the biggest source of AI-related electricity demand. However, as the availability of low-cost, high-performing models enables the development of more advanced AI applications, it may not take long for inference driven demand to dwarf training.\nInference-driven load growth will look fundamentally different from training-driven growth primarily by where it is located, rather than its speed and scale. Inference typically does not require large, concentrated compute. It can be distributed across multiple data centers all over the US or the globe. This reduces the need for building giant installations of concentrated electric power capacity and instead leaves a lot of flexibility in how much, where, and what kind of generation is needed. Indeed, if data center load can be managed in a flexible way, up to 100 GWs of new load could be integrated on the grid with minimal impact on reliability and little new additional capacity. With decentralized, flexible AI demand driven by inference, the opportunities for countries to scale up AI expand far beyond the countries that can make large amounts of power available quickly, raising questions about how the diffusion rule does or doesn’t constrain build out.\nRegardless of whether inference ends up driving energy demand, if DeepSeek or other model developers continue to act as fast followers to frontier model developers, the return on investment from ever larger data centers and centralized power may not be compelling, leading to a slow down or even a stall along the training paradigm.\nWhat to watch ahead\nThe next two to three years of capital expenditures on large, concentrated data centers and associated electric power supply in the US are largely baked in. We will be watching what people are planning for after that. If the training paradigm continues, speed and scale will be paramount. However, the practical supply chain, siting, and permitting constraints associated with this kind of buildout may prove obstacles despite the Trump administration’s efforts to streamline things. The US is currently on track for roughly 2% annual electric demand growth over the next decade (see Rhodium Group’s Taking Stock projections )—a pace the grid has not seen since the 1990s. Since World War II, the US has only managed to maintain linear growth, making it hard to envision how it can manage a rapid acceleration to maintain the training paradigm indefinitely. Over the past 25 years, electric demand globally has also been linear. If the inference paradigm takes center stage, we will be watching for more distributed data center and electric power buildout that is more opportunistic, flexible, and grows at the pace of AI adoption.\nTime is tyranny\nThe most potent variable in the current era of AI competition is time. As we have seen from innovations from OpenAI to DeepSeek, three mere months of model development can lead to path-breaking innovation, turning the market on its head. That innovation can yield rapid diffusion, enabling countries to turbocharge long-stagnant economies.\nBut time is tyranny for the world of regulators. There is a fundamental asymmetry between the pace of innovation and the speed at which regulators can, or even should, react. Months of critical delays to patching and enforcing tech controls threaten to eviscerate a nation’s technological lead. That in turn feeds an anxiety that threatens to pollute a climate of AI innovation with ever-blunter controls.\nThe five loaded assumptions we’ve unpacked in this note offer a sobering lesson in humility. Big moves with monumental implications are being made in compressed time. Striking the delicate balance between fostering cutting-edge innovation, safeguarding those investments, and containing geopolitical challengers demands unprecedented technical acumen, strategic foresight, and deft diplomacy. In the absence of any one of these critical elements, the consequences for global stability and technological progress could be extreme.\nFootnotes\nHigh-performance semiconductor restriction covers all items previously restricted for export to China and other US arms-embargoed countries under the October 17, 2023 chip controls (ECCN 3A090.a, 4A090.a, and related .z items.)\nSupplement No. 4 to part 742 country list includes EU members (minus Cyprus and Malta) plus UK, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, Canada. Australia, New Zealand, and Japan (Singapore, South Korea excluded.)\nHBM is produced by stacking and connecting multiple DRAM silicon dies vertically to achieve high memory density and accelerated data transfer rates.\nThe Foundry Due Dilligence rule requires “front-end fabricators” like TSMC to presume any advanced logic chip meets the performance thresholds stipulated in ECCN 3A090.a and are thus subject to US high-performance chip controls unless one of three conditions is met: 1) the chip designer is on a list of “approved” IC designers included in the appendix to the rule, and that designer attests that the chip falls below the ECCN 3A090 threshold; 2) The chip is packaged by a front-end fabricator located outside Country Group D:5 (China and other US arms embargoed countries) or Macau, which verifies that the chip does not contain HBM and has fewer than 30 billion transistors (gradually raised to 40 billion by 2029); or 3) the chip is packaged by an “approved” outsourced semiconductor assembly and test provider (OSAT), which verifies that the chip does not contain HBM or 30 billion+ transistors.\nTo evaluate which countries are most capable of providing a large amount of available energy capacity to scale AI compute quickly, we first focus on the countries with the fastest recent capacity build rates around the world. We adjust recent capacity additions by country based on average capacity factors and estimate how much new generation a country has added over the past five years that is surplus to what is required to meet demand growth over the same period. This allows for a consistent cross-country assessment of each country’s potential to meet the expected near-term surge in AI demand.\nStay connected with our regular newsletter\nKeep up to date with our latest news and events by\n                            subscribing to our newsletter\nChina\nEnergy\n                                            and Climate", "content_hash": "c963d59052dbf682e54f37df450429b048e35bff21d56bbdf2bdb5ee9f3a5409", "source_domain": "rhg.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 15547, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 123860, "ratings": []}

This is not a policy that began with the current US administration, nor has it been articulated in a speech or policy document. Instead, this is a pattern of observed behavior driven by growing US anxiety over growing dependencies on China in critical industries and infrastructure. Of course, the urgency to diversify away from China in sensitive sectors is not just a US phenomenon: Partner countries are working toward a similar goal, but their tactics will be subtler than their American counterparts and may still leave a door open for (conditional) Chinese investment. As the clawback becomes more visible in the coming months and years, expect Beijing to push back with tighter restrictions on outbound investment as it tries to hold onto prized assets from a decade-long M&A spree.\nBig regrets\nWhile there is a growing consensus in Washington that dependencies on China for critical goods and infrastructure constitute a major national security risk, the task of unwinding them has proven vexing. Tariffs or outright bans on China-origin products, from critical minerals to wireless routers, still requires time for other companies to fill the void and bring new production online, all while trying to remain cost-competitive amid rising trade uncertainty. But there is also a swifter path to resolving the dependency dilemma: the clawback, which we define as using various policy instruments to make it untenable for a strategic asset to remain under Chinese ownership on national security grounds. We have observed a collection of signals over the past year that indicate the clawback is taking shape, not just in the US, but also in partner countries that share similar anxieties over the presence of Chinese companies in strategic industries.\nThe clawback story is rooted in remorse. China’s global outbound investment saw rapid growth in the 2010s as Chinese firms—largely shielded from the worst effects of the global financial crisis—looked to new markets to expand and diversify. Companies were hungry for capital and geopolitical disruptions were waved off by investors as tail risks. When Beijing loosened restrictions on outward FDI in 2014, Chinese investment reached record highs of $200 billion in 2016 with an explosion of large-scale M&A deals. The bulk of China’s investment flows went toward acquisitions in developed markets in the US and Europe. But there are scores of transactions that took place during this period that would have had little chance of making it past national security filters in today’s geopolitical climate.\n\nSuch “big regret” deals include Chinese biotech giant BGI’s acquisition of US DNA-sequencing startup Complete Genomics in 2013, Hong-Kong conglomerate WH Group’s acquisition of US pork producer and food-processing giant Smithfield Foods in 2013, Chinese firm Midea’s acquisition of German robotics industry leader Kuka AG in 2016, the acquisition of Dutch legacy chip manufacturer Nexperia by a consortium of Chinese investors in 2017, and the ChemChina acquisition of Swiss agricultural technology firm Syngenta in 2017, among others ( Table A1 ).\nRebuilding an industrial base and reorganizing global trade is hard. The US is bound to seek out shortcuts in response to growing urgency to diversify away from China in critical sectors. As the US works to create ex-China technology and trade blocs, it will naturally be tempted by assets that once belonged to a network of trusted allies, or even by Chinese-owned assets that have become dominant in certain sectors of the US economy much to Washington’s regret. These are prime targets for policies aimed at rebuilding supply chain resilience and technological competitiveness at full tilt.\nThe clawback in action\nSeveral examples have surfaced over the past year of US attempts to claw back assets, usually through policies that force the question of whether Chinese ownership of assets in critical sectors is a sustainable business strategy. Each case study is unique in circumstance and methods, and many are still in early stages of the divorce process, but all speak to this broader trend of the US (and other like-minded governments) pursuing creative pathways to downsizing or outright eliminating Chinese stakes in key assets. This even includes some cases where the original owner and creator of the asset is Chinese or simply China-linked, yet the asset itself is critical enough to justify a takeover.\nHutchison Ports and BlackRock\nWhen addressing the US Congress on March 4, Trump stated, “my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it.” He was referencing a deal negotiated at breakneck speed for a consortium of investors involving BlackRock, its subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners, and Mediterranean Shipping Co.’s Terminal Investment Limited, to acquire a controlling stake of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings Limited in a $22.8 billion deal covering 43 ports across 23 countries. The mega deal includes a 90% stake in the Panama Ports Company, which operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, not to mention nearly the entirety of the company’s international port portfolio save for its port operations in Hong Kong and mainland China.\nTrump has made no secret of his expansionist ambitions to redraw the map of the United States. The US president is applying 19th century geopolitics and his real estate instincts to the dependency dilemma, trying to create the conditions for the US to assert control over territory to bridge critical supply and infrastructure gaps. In the Panama Canal example, the Trump administration asserts that critical port infrastructure was effectively in Chinese hands (since the US government regards Hong Kong as a political appendage of Beijing since the 2019-2020 crackdown), and that a naval chokepoint controlled by China constituted a national security risk to US trade flows and military movements. The Trump administration was already signaling its intent to litigate the provisions of historical treaties governing the Panama Canal. When the US transferred control of the canal to Panama in 1999, it was on the condition that “neutrality” of the international waterway would be preserved—a provision that could be challenged by the US allegation of Chinese control over port infrastructure. The treaty also explicitly states that the United States has the primary responsibility to protect and defend the Canal, to include the right “to take unilateral action to defend the Panama Canal against any threat.” In a sign that US pressure was working, Panama withdrew from China’s Belt and Road Initiative on February 6.\nSeeing the writing on the wall and eager to take the check, the CK Hutchison family conglomerate signed off on the $22.8 billion deal but must now answer to authorities in Beijing who regard the transaction as a betrayal of China’s global ambitions. On the heels of multiple opinion pieces in pro-Beijing media condemning the deal as “spineless groveling,” Beijing-backed Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said “any transaction must comply with the legal and regulatory requirements.” The ball is now in Beijing’s court: Chinese officials could assert pressure on Hong Kong to invoke its National Security Law to disrupt the transaction on the grounds that the deal stemmed from collusion with foreign officials. Beijing could also assert extraterritorial writ via its Anti-Monopoly Law given CK Hutchison’s market exposure in China. While Beijing would be challenging the deal on anti-competition and national security grounds, the US would argue that the carveout of Hong Kong and mainland ports mitigates this risk. This dynamic effectively pits a Chinese national security argument against a US one, with Washington ready and willing to re-litigate the Panama Canal treaties to get its way.\nWuxi Group’s pre-emptive restructuring\nIn some cases, US policy proposals are preemptively forcing corporate selloffs of Chinese assets even before those policies become law. This can be seen in the effects of the draft BIOSECURE Act, which is a response to rising US concerns over Chinese firms’ deepening role in American health supply chains and in the sensitive domain of biotech in particular. The bill, which was introduced in January 2024 and had companion versions in the House and Senate, sought to prohibit US federal agencies from contracting with certain named “biotechnology companies of concern.” The bill explicitly named five Chinese companies—BGI, MGI, Complete Genomics (which was acquired by BGI in 2013), Wuxi AppTec, and Wuxi Biologics, along with their subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors—but also left the door open for additional firms from foreign adversary countries to be added to the list. The proposed restrictions extend beyond these named firms, barring federal agencies from working with any biopharmaceutical manufacturer which would use equipment or services from these entities in fulfilling federal contracts.\nThe BIOSECURE Act advanced steadily through committee, gaining bipartisan traction along the way and comfortably passed the House in late September. The bill failed to make it in the final cut of the year-end of National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and continuing resolution (CR), but there is strong potential for the bill to be reintroduced in the current Congress.\nEven though the bill has not been formally enacted into law, it has already created a chilling effect on Chinese biotech firms. In late December 2024, Wuxi AppTec—one of the firms most exposed to the proposed restrictions, with 65% of its revenue derived from the US market—announced the sale of its cell and gene therapy manufacturing units in the US and UK to American investment firm Altaris. A month later, Wuxi Biologics—the second most exposed, generating 47% of its revenue from the US—disclosed the sale of its vaccine manufacturing site in Ireland to Merck, the facility’s sole client.\nNeither company has explicitly linked these divestments to the BIOSECURE Act, but the timing suggests that the not-yet-enacted bill is already prompting strategic restructuring to shed assets ahead of any formal restrictions, and to optimize margins in anticipation of mounting geopolitical headwinds.\nOther Chinese biotech players also appear to be shifting into preemptive damage control mode. A notable recent example is US firm Legend Biotech’s boardroom maneuvering to distance itself from the Chinese contract development and manufacturing organization GenScript, its majority shareholder. The board suspended some of GenScript’s voting rights—a possible attempt to limit control without triggering direct divestment. The move came just months after lawmakers from the House Select Committee on the CCP requested an intelligence briefing from the administration on GenScript and its US-based subsidiaries: Bestzyme, ProBio, and Legend Biotech. This has fueled speculation that GenScript could be added to the list of “biotechnology companies of concern.” While GenScript still retains a sizeable 47% stake in Legend Biotech, making the company highly susceptible to US regulatory scrutiny, Legend’s board may be making pre-emptive move ahead of regulators’ questions on its Chinese links.\nVolvo’s Geely dilemma\nThe US has a powerful clawback weapon in the form of Commerce’s Information and Communication Technology and Services (ICTS) rule. With this rule, the US can leverage its economic clout to force companies to restructure their supply chains and sever ties with Chinese ICTS suppliers if they want to preserve a foothold in the US market. As a result, Chinese ownership can become an instant liability for companies that need to preserve US market share.\nICTS restrictions that went into effect on March 17 require automakers selling into the US market to rapidly phase out certain Chinese hardware and software on the grounds that such technologies create undue national security risks, including sabotage (See Car Trouble: ICTS Rules Rewire Auto Supply Chains ). The restrictions also ban sales of vehicle (model year 2027) if the manufacturer is owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction of China. This is troubling news for Volvo, a Swedish company, which is majority-owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. Given that Volvo cars are popular among American consumers and that the US market makes up roughly 16% of Volvo’s global sales, we can infer that Volvo’s leadership is unlikely to forfeit the US market in response to the new restrictions. And this is precisely the point: The US rule allows for “special authorization” licenses for companies caught in a bind, so Commerce can leverage the license to press a firm like Volvo on its plans and timeline to “resolve” its Chinese ownership problem. We would expect that Volvo will face significant pressure to undergo a corporate restructuring. This could entail selling off its US operation or further discussion around the viability of Geely’s majority stake.\nPirelli’s tire pressure\nThe case of Italian tire maker Pirelli reveals how twin pressures coming from both Washington and a foreign government can combine to create the clawback effect. Chinese state-owned Sinochem invested in Pirelli in 2015 through its subsidiary, ChemChina, which acquired a controlling interest in the Italian tire maker for $7.7 billion. (ChemChina later merged with Sinochem). When Pirelli notified Rome of its intention to renew Sinochem’s shareholder agreement in early 2023, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government saw an opportunity to intervene. The Italian government used its so-called Golden Powers, which allow Rome to review transactions in a broad set of strategic sectors, to impose several governance measures. These included capping Sinochem’s board presence to nine of fifteen seats (with key decisions requiring an 80% supermajority), stripping Sinochem of the ability to appoint the CEO, severing organizational and functional ties between Pirelli and Sinochem, and banning transfer of cyber-derived data to China. Rome’s justification for the intervention was notably a bit of a stretch, arguing that advanced sensors embedded in Pirelli tires collect sensitive data.\nAfter Italy opened an investigation targeting Sinochem for a potential breach of the mitigation terms in November 2024, the controversy over Sinochem’s ownership is once again coming to a head. This time, however, US moves in the auto market are driving justification for the company’s leadership to demand that Sinochem shave down its 37% stake. The FT reported that a proposal has been put forth for Sinochem to reduce its stake to less than Italian shareholder Camfin’s 26.4% holding through share buybacks that can be immediately resold on the market. US ICTS restrictions on connected vehicles were cited as the justification: Restrictions covering Pirelli’s tire sensor technology could result in the firm losing 25% of its total North America revenue due to the rules banning use of certain components by Chinese-owned suppliers. The current ICTS scope does not cover tire sensors, so this may be a preemptive move that the firm is making to justify another intervention to shave down the Sinochem stake. Moreover, the Trump administration’s 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts is yet another pressure point on the company. The tariffs are designed to drive manufacturing investments in the United States, but Pirelli’s high exposure to a Chinese-owned company like Sinochem could complicate the company’s continency planning to preserve its North American market share.\nNexperia and Wingtech\nThe US can extend a long arm to force the clawback of strategic assets back into the partner fold. A prime case study centers on the Netherlands-based firm Nexperia, which produces mature node semiconductors and components for the automotive and industrial sectors.\nNexperia is a dizzying story of changing hands. Nexperia spun off from Dutch semiconductor firm NXP in 2017, when it was sold to a consortium of PRC state-affiliated investors led by JAC Capital and Wise Road Capital. Two years later, those initial investors turned around and sold Nexperia to Wingtech, a Chinese contract manufacturer of mobile phones and other electronic devices. After the acquisition, Nexperia claimed it would remain an independent Dutch company. But four months later, Wingtech founder Wing Zhang took over as CEO and instituted a broad management change that UK investigators described as a “stealth board takeover.” The result is a 100% Chinese-owned and Netherlands-based firm producing legacy chips primarily for the Western market.\nThis proves problematic as the US and G7 countries grow increasingly anxious that China’s rapid buildout in semiconductor manufacturing capacity will make them dependent on China for another foundational technology critical to the defense, automotive, and medical industries (see Thin Ice: US Pathways to Regulating China-Sourced Legacy Chips ). Given the immense cost and time it takes to bring new fabs online, not to mention the challenge in incentivizing chipmakers to allocate production capacity to mature node chip production when advanced node chipmaking fetches much higher revenue, it is only logical that European and US governments will look first to assets within their borders to address their growing legacy chip dilemma.\nIn this case, it was the UK government that initiated a partial clawback from Nexperia. The British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee lobbied for a review on the grounds that the UK’s largest semiconductor manufacturer owned by a company backed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) posed a critical national security risk. The UK government completed a security review in November 2022 and retroactively forced Nexperia to sell its stake in Newport Wafer Fab. After adopting an investment screening act in 2023, the Dutch government did its own retroactive review of Nexperia’s purchase of chip startup Nowi the same year. However, the Hague ultimately approved the deal after imposing security safeguards and made a controversial determination that Nexperia could be considered a Dutch company despite the fact that the firm remains 100% owned by Wingtech and is headed by Wingtech founder and CEO Wing Zhang.\nThe US now wants to push the Hague to finish the job on the Nexperia clawback. In December 2024, Commerce BIS added Nexperia’s Chinese owner Wingtech, along with the financiers of the Nexperia acquisition, Wise Road Capital and JAC Capital, to its Entity List for promoting China’s chip development via strategic investments and acquisitions. JAC Capital and Wise Road Capital sought out investments in strategic semiconductor assets and primed them for Chinese takeover. As investment scrutiny grew, Chinese-owned semiconductor firms shifted increasingly to greenfield investments with a focus on expanding capacity for mature node semiconductors (Figure 2, Table 1).\n\nWith their inclusion on the BIS Entity List, the US turned the Chinese stakeholders surrounding Nexperia into liabilities. But the US move appears to also have had an unintended consequence: On the heels of the listings and subsequent cancellations of big purchase orders by clients like Apple, Wingtech immediately sought to raise cash by striking a deal to sell Wingtech’s entire product assembly business to Chinese electronics giant Luxshare. As a result, Apple and other former Wingtech clients for product assembly are now even more dependent on a Chinese electronics manufacturer, while Nexperia (for now) remains in Wingtech’s hands.\nBig questions lie ahead. Will Washington or the Hague attempt to disrupt the Wingtech-Luxshare transaction? Will a severe downturn in US-EU relations under the Trump administration impede the Hague’s quiet efforts to address Nexperia’s Chinese ownership? Alternatively, will heavy US pressure on the Netherlands over semiconductor export control alignment and economic security standards for legacy chip production end up accelerating a Nexperia restructuring? This clawback story appears to be approaching its climax.\nQualified divestiture: TikTok on the clock\nTikTok, which faces an April 5 deadline to perform a “qualified divestiture” from its Chinese parent ByteDance, is the most high-profile example of the US taking over a Chinese asset. The move has been based on concerns that the popular social media app puts American data security at risk and exposes Americans to Chinese censorship and influence campaigns. Apart from the fate of TikTok itself, which has become a bargaining chip for the Trump administration, the legal precedent created by Congress’s so-called “TikTok bill” on forced divestitures is the bigger story. We expect this potent clawback tool in the US arsenal will be applied to cases beyond TikTok.\nIn April 2024, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA), also known as the TikTok bill, was signed into law, prohibiting any entity from distributing, maintaining, or updating a “foreign adversary-controlled application” within US borders unless the application completes a “qualified divestiture” within a set timeframe. According to the law, a qualified divestiture requires the president to certify that, after the transaction, the application is no longer controlled by—and has no operational ties to—a foreign adversary.\nTikTok, ByteDance, and other stakeholders sought to stop the legislation, but the DC Court of Appeals, and subsequently the Supreme Court, upheld the constitutionality of the law, and the notion of “qualified divestiture.” Notably, the DC Court of Appeals rejected TikTok’s argument that the law constitutes a prohibited legislative punishment under the Bill of Attainder since the qualified divestiture exemption grants the platform a pathway to overcome the prohibitions in the Act and return to the US market..The court also rejected TikTok’s claim that it constitutes a regulatory taking (i.e. an uncompensated taking of private property) because the law’s qualified divestiture exemption leaves TikTok “a number of possibilities short of total economic deprivation.”\nThe courts’ rulings carry implications well beyond the TikTok case. First, it opens the door for the President to invoke PAFACAA to mandate the qualified divestitures of other “foreign adversary-controlled” apps which meet the law’s criteria. Second, it sets the stage for the concept of qualified divestiture to be replicated in other legislative efforts targeting Chinese ownership in sensitive sectors under congressional scrutiny.\nAll eyes are now on how Trump 2.0 handles the TikTok case. The deal he brokers will establish the baseline for what constitutes an acceptable restructuring—and will test the limits of his transactional approach when it comes to how much residual Chinese ownership or influence, if any, is considered tolerable.\nExpanding the toolkit\nEye on CFIUS: Retroactive reviews?\nThough the tactics in the case studies above vary widely—from highly transactional executive deal-making to turning Chinese assets into liabilities via entity listings—the natural place to look for clawback authorities is the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). While CFIUS has become more assertive in recent years in reviewing and blocking investments with problematic Chinese linkages, it still faces jurisdictional limitations especially on unwinding closed transactions. The Trump administration made clear in its America First Investment Memo that it is already considering expanding CFIUS’s jurisdiction to new sectors and new types of transactions. We are now watching whether this momentum also results in a move by the current administration to expand CFIUS’s authority to support clawbacks on retroactive deals.\nWith the passage of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act in 2018, CFIUS gained relatively broad powers to retroactively review “non-notified” transactions, or deals that fit within CFIUS’s scope of covered transactions but were not properly notified for review. The committee has a dedicated team to review thousands of potential deals every year, and has taken already action under its non-notified authority to unwind deals well beyond their close. For example, CFIUS reportedly required Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech to sell off US dating app Grindr in 2019, ostensibly owing to concerns over access to users’ sensitive personal data and geolocation. The forced unwinding came three years after Kunlun had first gained effective control of the company in 2016. But ultimately, CFIUS’s retroactive review of non-notified transactions is still bound to deals that fall within its scope of covered transactions. For now, this still notably excludes most greenfield investments 1 —an increasingly visible gap now drawing scrutiny from Congress and the administration.\nCFIUS’s power to unwind transactions that it has officially reviewed is even more constrained. Transactions that were formally notified and either cleared without further action or subject to a mitigation agreement receive a so-called “safe harbor” from retroactive review. CFIUS may only waive this safe harbor in cases where parties have “submitted false or misleading material information” or “materially breached” 2 a mitigation agreement or condition, and if “the Committee determines that there are no other adequate and appropriate remedies or enforcement tools available to address such breach.” This amounts to a high legal bar that risks lengthy court battles and limits CFIUS from revisiting deals based on shifting perceptions of national security concerns.\nCFIUS has increased its enforcement of mitigation agreements in recent years, most notably issuing a $60 million penalty against T-Mobile for breaching mitigation terms. But Trump 2.0’s America First Investment Policy Memo announced an intent to abolish mitigation agreements altogether for deals involving investors from foreign adversary states like China. The memo described mitigation agreements as “overly bureaucratic,” “complex,” and ultimately insufficient for resolving national security risks. The administration’s tweaks to investment screening still need to take shape but we are watching whether the Trump administration and Congress try to lower the bar for revisiting ongoing mitigation agreements.\nQuectel and the limits of licensing\nThe ICTS rule will be deployed against multiple targets, especially as US concerns intensify over data security and cybersecurity breaches from critical infrastructure laden with Chinese ICT components. As the Volvo/Geely example demonstrates, outright bans on Chinese-owned products and services could compel a corporate restructuring to preserve US market share. But one of the ways Chinese firms could try to get around such restrictions is through creative licensing deals with US firms hungry for Chinese tech.\nThe ICTS final rule (Dec. 2024) included an expanded scope to cover 11 emerging technologies, including:\nAdvanced network sensing and signature management, advanced computing;\nArtificial intelligence;\nClean energy generation and storage;\nData privacy, data security, and cybersecurity technologies;\nHighly automated, autonomous, and uncrewed systems and robotics;\nIntegrated communication and networking technologies;\nPositioning, navigation, and timing technologies;\nQuantum information and enabling technologies;\nSemiconductors and microelectronics; and\nBiotechnology\nThe final rule also included expansive language on what transactions involving Chinese stakeholders could be subject to investigation. According to the rule, a company can be considered owned or controlled by a foreign adversary “through the ownership of a majority or a dominant minority of the total outstanding voting interest in an entity, board representation, proxy voting, a special share, contractual arrangements, formal or informal arrangements to act in concert, or other means, to determine, direct, or decide important matters affecting an entity.” The broad scope would presumably capture licensing deals, which is particularly notable given attempts by US automaker Ford to forge a technology licensing deal with Chinese battery maker CATL for investments in the US. Ford was creating a template for companies to compensate for technology gaps in an area dominated by Chinese suppliers but has been hitting stiff political resistance at the local and federal level.\nThe test is whether a company can secure political support to pursue a licensing deal to acquire critical know-how and with the intent of shedding its Chinese linkage when self-sufficiency is attained. The Trump administration’s approach to such transactions still needs to be tested. US companies may try to probe the bounds of the ICTS rule by making the case that outright bans will leave critical gaps and that instead, technology licensing deals are the quickest and most effective pathway to bringing necessary IP into American hands. US startup firm Eagle Electronics is a case in point: The Ohio-based firm is on a mission to reshore electronics supply chains and create American jobs, starting with cellular modules. Notably, the firm has struck a partnership with Chinese internet of things (IoT) giant Quectel to license the Chinese firm’s technology to manufacture cellular modules in Ohio. The IoT domain is already under intense scrutiny by US policymakers over the cybersecurity and data security risks stemming from China’s global dominance in IoT modules and the pervasiveness of such components in US critical infrastructure. If Eagle Electronics can make a convincing security argument that a temporary alliance of convenience with a Chinese tech supplier is the swiftest path to diversification, then other corporates could follow.\nBut there’s a catch: if Beijing suspects that US companies are following a “reverse IP transfer” playbook, with the goal of ultimately divorcing their Chinese partner once they achieve self-sufficiency, Chinese regulators may tighten up outbound investment restrictions and export controls to prevent such transactions.\nWhen couples therapy fails\nDivorcing a Chinese corporate parent is complicated. There is no one method to doing it, but there are several tactics that are known to be practiced and that are usually negotiated behind the scenes among corporate boards and teams of lawyers. Some tactics include the following:\nIPO exit strategy : A negotiated outcome could result in the Chinese owner selling down its stake over time via a public listing. This can typically involve a bargain between the two parties in which the owners of the asset trying to shed Chinese ownership sell non-critical assets to the Chinese owner while the Chinese stakeholder agrees to an IPO to create an escape route and sell down its stake.\nSell majority stake to a financial investor: If the asset in question sells to a private equity firm on a mandate to cut spending, it can create the conditions to sell the Chinese stake more rapidly once the entity is on the financial hook to restructure.\nDilute the stake with a merger: The asset in question could pursue a merger with a much bigger entity to effectively dilute their Chinese stake. The Chinese stakeholder can then wind down its share over time.\nSplit the baby: Through a negotiated settlement, the asset in question could retain parts of the business that services the Western market while selling the parts of the business serving the Chinese or broader Asian market to the Chinese owner.\nPick a side: In some cases, a company may make a judgement about where the bigger market opportunity lies and attempt to divorce their host government. Re-domiciling a business would entail changing legal jurisdiction from China to the United States (or other jurisdiction) and de-registering the business in China. This is a complicated pathway, however. The US has grown alert to Chinese companies registering in jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands. For example, US Treasury outbound investment restrictions in sensitive technologies can be applied extraterritorially to entities, even if domiciled outside China, Hong Kong, or Macau. If the Chinese company’s leadership has dual citizenship in the US or partner country and drops their Chinese citizenship altogether, along with any other business linkages in China, this could mitigate the risk in the eyes of US authorities. However, the Chinese entity would still have to be alert to attempts by Chinese regulators to disrupt such moves as well as US regulations that could apply a broader scope to what constitutes exposure to China.\nBeijing strikes back\nBeijing is growing alert to the clawback playbook. The growing backlash against the CK Hutchison port deal in China’s state media, along with recent reporting that several Chinese agencies have been instructed to examine their options to review the transaction, indicate that Beijing is preparing its toolkit to disrupt clawback attempts as well as preemptive moves by companies seeking to distance themselves from their Chinese parents. Beijing’s response may take multiple forms, ranging from political pressure to legal and regulatory maneuvers.\nExport controls\nBeijing could attempt to blunt the sale of certain Chinese-owned assets through targeted export controls on key technologies. This was Beijing’s playbook to thwart the initial forced sale of TikTok in 2020: MOFCOM added “personalized information push-service technology” to its technology export control catalogue, which was widely understood to capture TikTok’s prized recommendation algorithm. Since then, MOFCOM has steadily broadened its export control regime to cover a wider array of strategically sensitive technologies, including those related to rare earth refining and extraction, drone systems, and LiDAR. More recently, MOFCOM has signaled possible controls on EV battery cathode production technologies, as well as lithium and gallium extraction. While the controls primarily reflect China’s desire to preserve its technological edge, they also offer preemptive leverage in sectors where Chinese firms are facing growing scrutiny.\nMerger control\nChina’s merger control authority, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), has the authority to investigate transactions—even those outside China’s borders—when the parties involved meet certain revenue thresholds in China. SAMR also reserves the right to review below-threshold transactions if it believes the deal could impact fair competition in China. This gives SAMR ample leeway to scrutinize a broad range of transactions on anti-competition grounds, including cases where a Chinese majority stake is sold to foreign financial investor, or where the Chinese stake is diluted as part of a merger.\nFor example, SAMR could investigate the CK Hutchison port deal on the grounds that the BlackRock-led consortium would gain a dominant market position and potentially restrict access for other operators in ways that harm China’s national security. In 2014, MOFCOM (which dealt with some merger review before SAMR was created in 2018) blocked a proposed vessel-sharing agreement between European shipping giants Maersk, MSC, and CMA CGM, arguing it would restrict competition on Asia–Europe shipping routes.\nShort of formally or informally prohibiting a transaction, 3 SAMR could also impose intrusive conditional remedies that make it difficult for all parties to satisfy SAMR’s demands and complete the transaction. In recent years, SAMR’s remedies have grown more creative in a bid to blunt the effects of US tech controls, with conditions such as requirements for parties to maintain production and R&D in China, maintain prices, transfer IP, and even allow stockpiling for Chinese customers.\nBut if Beijing relies on SAMR to challenge politically loaded transactions like the CK Hutchison port deal, the move could backfire. China has already weaponized SAMR reviews in probing US big tech firms like NVIDIA. If the US sees SAMR as a tool to disrupt the top priorities on its national security agenda, then it could argue that SAMR’s review is invalid and provide legal backing to its own firms to not recognize SAMR’s authority. It would then be up to Beijing to decide whether to apply punitive action to the asset exposed directly to the China market and rely on intimidation tactics to try and get the China-exposed party to ditch the deal on its own. To this end, China has reportedly instructed state-owned firms to pause new deals with businesses linked to Hong Kong business magnate Li Ka-shing and his family over the CK Hutchison deal.\nNational security review\nThere are several provisions of varying levels of specificity scattered across China’s national security laws that Beijing could invoke to review foreign investment transactions that threaten its national security ( Table A2 ). Notably, the NDRC and MOFCOM jointly established a CFIUS-style working mechanism in 2021 under the updated Foreign Investment Security Review Measures . These measures empower the joint working mechanism to investigate, mitigate, or prohibit transactions in certain strategic sectors, including cases where “foreign investors obtain equity or assets of domestic enterprises through mergers and acquisitions.”\nThere has been speculation that China could invoke this mechanism to review the CK Hutchison port deal, though questions remain as to whether the measures, as currently written, allow Beijing to probe deals involving offshore companies like CK Hutchison or involving assets outside China’s borders. 4 That said, Beijing could likely engineer a creative workaround or update the wording of the regulation if it chooses to pursue this pathway. To date, there has been no public reporting of deals being formally reviewed under this authority, making it difficult to precisely gauge the range of China’s defensive options through national security reviews.\nOverseas listing review\nBeijing could also intervene via the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), its securities regulator, in cases where firms try to IPO outside mainland China to reduce their Chinese stake. The CSRC’s measures governing overseas listings grant it broad discretion to prohibit domestic companies from listing overseas if this would jeopardize national security. The CSRC’s purview extends not just to IPOs, but also to a broad range of post-listing activities including follow-on share issuances, secondary listings, share swaps, transfers of shares or M&A activities. This gives the CSRC a powerful lever on listed firms attempting to wind down Chinese ownership.\nSanctions\nBeijing also has a growing arsenal of sanctions mechanisms it can deploy in response to US clawback efforts. These are more likely to be applied asymmetrically than in tit-for-tat fashion. Tools such as the Unreliable Entities List and the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law provide legal grounds for China to target foreign firms or individuals that are seen as threatening national interests. Chinese regulations explicitly state that foreign entities that support, implement, or assist in the implementation of discriminatory measures against China’s national security interests could land on its sanctions lists. US gene-sequencing specialist Illumina’s recent inclusion on the Unreliable Entities List was reportedly tied to its lobbying efforts in favor of the draft BIOSECURE Act, which, as explained above, could force Chinese biotechs to divest from their activities.\nBeijing could continue targeting foreign firms it sees as supporting clawback-related policies or escalate by sanctioning Chinese parent companies in the early stages of the “divorce process” as a deterrent to others. It could also turn its focus to intermediaries facilitating such divestments—for example, law firms, consultancies, or financial institutions underwriting or advising these transactions. In a more escalatory scenario, China may even consider sanctioning the acquiring firm itself, though Beijing would have to weigh such a move against the cost of cutting its market off from globally integrated firms like BlackRock in the CK Hutchison port deal example.\nCatalyzing the clawback\nThe clawback—and Beijing’s response—will manifest in a range of tactics depending on the asset, corporate stakeholders, and governments in question. For this reason, we do not expect to see a coherent policy articulated around the theme of (re)taking critical assets on national security grounds. Nonetheless, the clawback trend will be a critical geopolitical undercurrent shaping global investment in the coming decade.

This angst feeds ambitious industrial policies, precautionary regulations, and multibillion-dollar investments. Yet even as governments and private industry race for supremacy in artificial intelligence, none of them possess a clear vision of what “winning” looks like or what geopolitical returns their investments will yield.\nMuch more than computing dominance is at stake; the struggle for AI primacy between the United States, China, middle powers, and Big Tech is fundamentally a competition over whose vision of the world order will reign supreme. For the United States, AI is a new frontier on which it must maintain its global technological dominance. As U.S. policymakers deploy a regulatory arsenal to cripple China’s technology development and stay ahead, China is mobilizing the power of the state to close the gap. At the same time, middle powers trying to avoid coming under the shadow of either superpower, along with tech companies devoted to the global diffusion of technology through open markets, see AI development paving the path to a multipolar world.\nAlready, U.S. technology controls and China’s escalatory response are creating a snowball effect: as the United States, bent on preserving tech primacy, resorts to more aggressive measures to throttle Chinese AI development, a cornered China will hunt for leverage over the United States, including, potentially, in security flash points such as the Taiwan Strait. Middle powers and tech companies, meanwhile, will strive to build AI systems and applications outside the confines of great-power rivalry—both looking to stake a claim to the new technological order even as they risk getting caught in the crossfire. As the tenor of the global AI race grows existential, the high-stakes wagers of tech titans and world powers risk geopolitical combustion.\nPROTECT THE LEAD\nThe United States is building its AI strategy on the assumption that it can preserve its hegemony offensively, through a rate of technological innovation that outpaces the rest of the world, and defensively, through far-reaching technology controls aimed at hobbling China, its biggest geopolitical challenger. Export controls and investment restrictions are designed to cut off the flow of goods, capital, and technological know-how from Beijing. Washington’s strategy assumes that China is in structural economic decline, its statist approach stifling the animal spirits of an economy at the mercy of the Communist Party and its general secretary, Xi Jinping.\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs This Week\nOur editors’ top picks, delivered free to your inbox every Friday.\n* Note that when you provide your email address, the Foreign Affairs Privacy Policy and Terms of Use will apply to your newsletter subscription.\nIt also puts enormous stock in the the pervasiveness and competitiveness of U.S. technology. Washington is betting that partners who may resist aligning with its protectionist strategy will ultimately cast their lot with U.S. technology and the promise of Western AI innovation rather than gamble on China closing the gap and risk running afoul of U.S. sanctions. After all, U.S. technology and intellectual property dominate every level of the AI industry. Nvidia’s AI accelerators increase computing power by orders of magnitude, driving the AI revolution; U.S. cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, distribute massive computing resources and cloud infrastructure; and companies such as Google, Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI have developed the foundational AI models that companies all over the world will rely on to fine-tune their AI applications.\nThe United States holds unique leverage in this early stage in the development of AI. Large-scale AI models, particularly in generative AI, which uses patterns learned from existing data to create new content, require immense computational power and vast amounts of data, the resources for which few companies outside the United States possess. The United States’ lead in this industry is not an accident; it has attracted more than $328 billion in investment over the past five years to promote AI development and foster a culture in which risk-taking is rewarded. Building on the Biden administration’s suite of industrial policies expanding domestic chip manufacturing, the incoming Trump administration has touted an “AI Manhattan Project” to turbocharge a U.S.-led AI industrial revolution.\nU.S. tech hegemony is not impregnable, however. The development and diffusion of AI technology could dilute the United States’ current advantages. Generative AI development to date has largely been focused on obtaining the huge amounts of computational power, data, and energy required to train large-scale AI models, for which access to the world’s most advanced chips has been critical. U.S. dominance of the production of these chips through companies such as Nvidia and AMD has enabled the U.S. government to tighten export controls to severely restrict that access. The United States is trying to hobble China’s domestic AI development, in particular, by cutting off its supply of high-end chips and the equipment and components needed to manufacture advanced node semiconductors.\n\nBut Washington finds itself in an awkward phase of that strategy. Despite a barrage of U.S.-led chip controls, Huawei’s HiSilicon and SMIC, China’s leading chip designer and manufacturer, respectively, leading China’s push for self-reliance, are producing high-performance AI accelerators used in data centers, such as the Ascend 910C processor, which is nearly as advanced as Nvidia’s H100 and A100 chips. Still, Chinese production has been far less efficient than that of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which uses state-of-the-art manufacturing technology to produce cutting-edge chips.\nChinese engineers are being flooded with state resources to innovate their way out of U.S.-imposed constraints on chip production. AI development is shifting away from maximization of computational power for training large-scale models and toward optimization to get pretrained models to generate more sophisticated responses to queries. Nvidia and other leading companies are already focusing less on shrinking transistor nodes at the atomic level and more on performance gains across the full AI system, from the design of the chips themselves to the cooling systems used to integrate the hardware in data centers. When launching the first round of chip controls in October 2022, U.S. policymakers assumed that process node miniaturization was the fundamental chokepoint to “freeze in place” Chinese chip production. But with Huawei leading China’s self-reliance efforts, China has demonstrated that it still has the process engineering ability, manpower, and sheer tenacity to keep up with industry advances in performance optimization.\nConcern about the United States’ ability to create a wide enough lead over China in AI development will lead to blunter controls, less patience for partners that do not align their own policies with U.S. export restrictions, and swifter application of extraterritorial measures. In December, the U.S. Department of Commerce released a package of semiconductor controls that exemplifies this approach, using far-reaching restrictions to force partners into alignment and to throttle Chinese production. But if Chinese companies are still able to scale their computing power, and gaps in partner alignment on chip controls remain, Washington will likely adopt blocking sanctions on Huawei and expand trade restrictions to include China’s AI tech champions. The potential blow to the Chinese economy and Beijing’s geopolitical ambition would heighten the stakes of the AI and chip war.\nPLAYING CATCH-UP\nChina assumes that it is on equal geopolitical footing with the United States in a bipolar world. For Beijing, AI development is both the path to preserving parity with Washington and the antidote to its domestic economic challenges. China has intrinsic strengths: the sheer size of its population and the country’s massive industries give it an enormous well of data to draw from in training AI models and the opportunity to pioneer AI applications for manufacturing. Thanks in part to their large pools of employees willing to work long hours, Chinese tech champions such as Alibaba, Baidu, DeepSeek AI, Huawei, and Tencent are competitive with U.S. peers in large language model development and cloud infrastructure. China has also put enormous resources into optimizing power generation for data centers; it is now the fastest developer of energy generation in the world. Beijing is betting that high levels of state funding for AI-powered industries will pay off, especially if overreaching trade and technology controls alienate U.S. partners, drive them into China’s arms, and open up new markets for Chinese technology. From China’s perspective, this strategy is the country’s best (and only) hope to arrest recent economic malaise and to avoid subordination to the United States.\nBut China also faces significant vulnerabilities, most notably in its ability to develop the AI hardware needed to keep pace with the United States. As U.S. technologists create ever more efficient AI chips and dynamic AI models, China’s leading foundries will have to devote considerable resources just to maintain their chip production capabilities as tightening U.S. controls restrict their access to key components. This diverted energy will make it more difficult to keep pace with U.S. innovation. Chinese AI developers will face a dual challenge of seeking breakthrough innovation amid stifling U.S. tech controls while also complying with the nebulous Communist Party mandate that AI models “uphold socialist values.”\nU.S.-led chip controls have not been impenetrable to date, but more aggressive U.S. controls could reduce the ability of foreign toolmakers, chip designers, and foundries to maintain a foothold in China’s chip market. If the United States builds on current de-risking momentum and coordinates with partners effectively, China could find itself increasingly excluded from emerging U.S.-led technology and trade blocs that reserve access to data and critical digital infrastructure for like-minded countries. Any potential reorganization of trade blocs would be disastrous for China’s ability to expand to foreign markets, especially at a time when its tech giants are relying on overseas growth to compensate for the structural decline of the domestic economy.\nIf China struggles to keep pace in chip development, and Beijing fears that this will make it fall further behind the United States in the AI race, the state could direct Chinese tech juggernauts to centralize and scale their computing resources. But such a step would expose China further to U.S. tech controls. For now, Huawei’s HiSilicon is the country’s preeminent AI chip designer. But Huawei is also the Chinese tech company most heavily sanctioned by the United States. Huawei’s chips are manufactured by SMIC, China’s state-owned foundry, which, like Huawei, is now subject to U.S. foreign direct product rule restrictions. These are designed to prevent components from any country from going to SMIC plants where advanced chips are being manufactured. If the government orders Chinese AI model developers to pool their resources to support the state’s AI development, they, too, would become prime targets for severe U.S. sanctions that would undermine their efforts to expand their market shares outside China. The United States has already expanded export control categories to include the gray area of firms engaged in military “support” activities. The justification for broader controls is already baked into U.S. rules and is waiting to be deployed.\nGOLDEN TICKET?\nMiddle powers and Big Tech leaders have yet another outlook on the global AI competition. Many of them see the diffusion of technology as enabling the new era of multipolarity. With the United States and China locked in a contest for AI primacy, countries such as France, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates have started to build sovereign AI systems that make use of their national strengths: control over data access, intimate knowledge of their respective economies, and expertise in their respective languages and cultures to mitigate bias. The UAE, for example, may deploy up to $100 billion over the next few years as part of the country’s goal to be a global AI leader by 2031. These gains reflect middle powers’ status anxiety, as well as their recognition of the opportunity to carve out niches for themselves amid U.S.-Chinese competition.\nNvidia’s founder, Jensen Huang, has been quick to acknowledge the mix of anxiety and aspiration among middle powers. He has toured Canada, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam, delivering the same seductive message: every country needs its own sovereign AI to reflect its language, culture, and ambitions. Meta, meanwhile, has open-sourced its Llama large language model, sharing its blueprint for building the model with the world. Open-sourcing makes it easier for the technology to diffuse across borders. It also may erode the competitive advantages of Meta’s closed-model rivals, including OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini. Unlike their competitors, which have erected proprietary walls around their technology to protect their innovation, open-source advocates such as Meta hope an expanded ecosystem of developers will encourage widespread adoption of and innovation on their own platform.\nFor most countries, however, achieving AI sovereignty is more complicated than tech leaders make it out to be. Middle powers can build AI infrastructure, but they will likely be doing so with U.S. semiconductors, cloud infrastructure, and a heavy reliance on U.S. talent and U.S.-origin AI foundation models. The ubiquity of U.S. technology enables Washington to impose conditions on partners, such as excluding Chinese firms from their supply chains and preventing Chinese access to U.S.-built AI systems, on the grounds that Chinese companies pose national security risks.\nFinding the optimal level of AI regulation will also be a challenge. Many tech leaders prefer a light touch on AI regulation to clear the path for private industry to innovate without getting bogged down by heavy compliance requirements, but their appeals may not always align with U.S. government priorities to impose restrictions that block out China and countries willing to work with China. For example, open-source business models alarm security-minded policymakers who fear that unrestricted access could enable adversaries to more easily develop or exploit sensitive technology. Meanwhile, middle powers lacking a strong domestic tech base will try to assert their relevance by passing regulation that creates a de facto global standard for AI development. In August, the EU AI Act came into force as the world’s first comprehensive AI law. It was met with significant criticism, including from the former European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, who warned that the law’s “precautionary approach” to regulation would be onerous, and advised that deregulation is urgently needed to “close the innovation gap with the U.S. and China.”\nCHIPS ON THE TABLE\nWith nothing less than competing visions for the world order at stake, competitors will do all they can to gain the upper hand. Unintended consequences will follow. U.S. regulators may be overzealous in their controls. If Washington pursues proposed quotas on the number of U.S.-made AI chips other countries are able to procure, for example, it may undermine its leverage to lock in strategic dependencies for U.S. technology in fast-growing markets. U.S. officials might also be underestimating the momentum of China’s technology innovation. Overconfident in the efficacy of export controls, they could prematurely see inefficiencies in SMIC chip production as evidence of their policies’ success, while domestic Chinese suppliers make strides with heavy state backing and Chinese foundation model developers such as DeepSeekAI and Alibaba pool enough high-end computing power to rival their U.S. peers.\nIf Washington comes to believe that the AI technology gap between the two superpowers is closing, it will push for blunter measures. This would likely entail imposing full blocking sanctions on Huawei and more draconian restrictions on Chinese AI tech champions. If China’s tech giants are denied markets abroad while its statist economic model is faltering at home, a cornered Beijing may interpret the United States’ moves as an existential threat, creating the conditions for the technology war to potentially spill into the security sphere.\nChina’s leadership could respond to intensified trade restrictions with escalatory moves elsewhere. Assuming that Washington would try to avoid direct war, Beijing could test its rival’s limits with more serious gray-zone maneuvers in the Taiwan Strait. For instance, China could establish a customs quarantine that effectively asserts the mainland’s writ over Taiwanese ports of entry and challenges Taiwan’s political sovereignty. Such a step would have dramatic consequences, not only for the future of semiconductor supply chains as assets and investment flee Taiwan but also for the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific.\nFor now, the unbridled optimism of technologists will keep the AI revolution moving forward, in hopes that the spread of the technology will transform humanity. At the same time, the anxiety of policymakers, who see economic and security risks lurking at every corner, will continue to drive efforts to channel AI competition toward zero-sum geopolitical goals. All recognize that power will accrue to those who hold the keys to AI development and deployment. As countries and tech giants jockey for position, the geopolitical tempest that ensues may overshadow the transformative potential of the technology.\nYou are reading a free article\nSubscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.\nPaywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives\nSix issues a year in print and online, plus audio articles\nUnlock access to the Foreign Affairs app for reading on the go\nAlready a subscriber?

Here’s what researchers are trying to do about it.\nDan Garisto archive page\nIn 1977, Ray and Charles Eames released a remarkable film that, over the course of just nine minutes, spanned the limits of human knowledge. Powers of Ten begins with an overhead shot of a man on a picnic blanket inside a one-square-­meter frame. The camera pans out: 10, then 100 meters, then a kilometer, and eventually all the way to the then-known edges of the observable universe—10 24 meters. There, at the farthest vantage, it reverses. The camera zooms back in, flying through galaxies to arrive at the picnic scene, where it plunges into the man’s skin, digging down through successively smaller scales: tissues, cells, DNA, molecules, atoms, and eventually atomic nuclei—10 -14 meters. The narrator’s smooth voice-over ends the journey: “As a single proton fills our scene, we reach the edge of present understanding.”\nDuring the intervening half-century, particle physicists have been exploring the subatomic landscape where Powers of Ten left off. Today, much of this global effort centers on CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC), an underground ring 17 miles (27 kilometers) around that straddles the border between Switzerland and France. There, powerful magnets guide hundreds of trillions of protons as they do laps at nearly the speed of light underneath the countryside. When a proton headed clockwise plows into a proton headed counterclockwise, the churn of matter into energy transmutes the protons into debris: electrons, photons, and more exotic subatomic bric-a-brac. The newly created particles explode radially outward, where they are picked up by detectors.\nIn 2012, using data from the LHC, researchers discovered a particle called the Higgs boson. In the process, they answered a nagging question: Where do fundamental particles, such as the ones that make up all the protons and neutrons in our bodies, get their mass? A half-­century earlier, theorists had cautiously dreamed the Higgs boson up, along with an accompanying field that would invisibly suffuse space and provide mass to particles that interact with it. When the particle was finally found, scientists celebrated with champagne. A Nobel for two of the physicists who predicted the Higgs boson soon followed.\nBut now, more than a decade after the excitement of finding the Higgs, there is a sense of unease, because there are still unanswered questions about the fundamental constituents of the universe.\nPerhaps the most persistent of these questions is the identity of dark matter, a mysterious substance that binds galaxies together and makes up 27% of the cosmos’s mass. We know dark matter must exist because we have astronomical observations of its gravitational effects. But since the discovery of the Higgs, the LHC has seen no new particles—of dark matter or anything else—despite nearly doubling its collision energy and quintupling the amount of data it can collect. Some physicists have said that particle physics is in a “crisis,” but there is disagreement even on that characterization: another camp insists the field is fine and still others say that there is indeed a crisis, but that crisis is good. “I think the community of particle phenomenologists is in a deep crisis, and I think people are afraid to say those words,” says Yoni Kahn, a theorist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\nThe anxieties of particle physicists may, at first blush, seem like inside baseball. In reality, they concern the universe, and how we can continue to study it—of interest if you care about that sort of thing. The past 50 years of research have given us a spectacularly granular view of nature’s laws, each successive particle discovery clarifying how things really work at the bottom. But now, in the post-Higgs era, particle physicists have reached an impasse in their quest to discover, produce, and study new particles at colliders. “We do not have a strong beacon telling us where to look for new physics,” Kahn says.\nSo, crisis or no crisis, researchers are trying something new. They are repurposing detectors to search for unusual-looking particles, squeezing what they can out of the data with machine learning, and planning for entirely new kinds of colliders. The hidden particles that physicists are looking for have proved more elusive than many expected, but the search is not over—nature has just forced them to get more creative.\nAn almost-complete theory\nAs the Eameses were finishing Powers of Ten in the late ’70s, particle physicists were bringing order to a “zoo” of particles that had been discovered in the preceding decades. Somewhat drily, they called this framework, which enumerated the kinds of particles and their dynamics, the Standard Model.\nRoughly speaking, the Standard Model separates fundamental particles into two types: fermions and bosons. Fermions are the bricks of matter—two kinds of fermions called up and down quarks, for example, are bound together into protons and neutrons. If those protons and neutrons glom together and find an electron (or electrons) to orbit them, they become an atom. Bosons, on the other hand, are the mortar between the bricks. Bosons are responsible for all the fundamental forces besides gravity: electromagnetism; the weak force, which is involved in radioactive decay; and the strong force, which binds nuclei together. To transmit a force between one fermion and another, there must be a boson to act as a messenger. For example, quarks feel the attractive power of the strong force because they send and receive bosons called gluons.\nThe Standard Model\nThis framework unites three out of four fundamental forces and tamed an unruly zoo into just 17 elementary particles.\nQuarks are bound together by gluons. They form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei.\nLeptons can be charged or neutral. The charged leptons are the electron, muon, and tau. Each of these has a neutral neutrino counterpart.\nGauge bosons convey forces. Gluons carry the strong force; photons carry the electromagnetic force; and W and Z bosons carry the weak force, which is involved in radioactive processes.\nThe Higgs boson is the fundamental particle associated with the Higgs field, a field that permeates the entire universe and gives mass to other fundamental particles.\n\nNearly 50 years later, the Standard Model remains superbly successful; even under stress tests, it correctly predicts fundamental properties of the universe, like the magnetic properties of the electron and the mass of the Z boson, to extremely high accuracy. It can reach well past where Powers of Ten left off, to the scale of 10 -20 meters, roughly a 10,000th the size of a proton. “It’s remarkable that we have a correct model for how the world works down to distances of 10 -20 meters. It’s mind blowing,” says Seth Koren, a theorist at the University of Notre Dame, in Indiana.\nDespite its accuracy, physicists have their pick of questions the Standard Model doesn’t answer—what dark matter actually is, why matter dominates over antimatter when they should have been made in equal amounts in the early universe, and how gravity fits into the picture.\nOver the years, thousands of papers have suggested modifications to the Standard Model to address these open questions. Until recently, most of these papers relied on the concept of supersymmetry, abbreviated to the friendlier “SUSY.” Under SUSY, fermions and bosons are actually mirror images of one another, so that every fermion has a boson counterpart, and vice versa. The photon would have a superpartner dubbed a “photino” in SUSY parlance, while an electron would have a “selectron.” If these particles were high in mass, they would be “hidden,” unseen unless a sufficiently high-energy collision left them as debris. In other words, to create these heavy superpartners, physicists needed a powerful particle collider.\nIt might seem strange, and overly complicated, to double the number of particles in the universe without direct evidence. SUSY’s appeal was in its elegant promise to solve two tricky problems. First, superpartners would explain the Higgs boson’s oddly low mass. The Higgs is about 100 times more massive than a proton, but the math suggests it should be 100 quadrillion times more massive. (SUSY’s quick fix is this: every particle that interacts with the Higgs contributes to its mass, causing it to balloon. But each superpartner would counteract its ordinary counterpart’s contribution, getting the mass of the Higgs under control.) The second promise of SUSY: those hidden particles would be ideal candidates for dark matter.\nSUSY was so nifty a fix to the Standard Model’s problems that plenty of physicists thought they would find superpartners before they found the Higgs boson when the LHC began taking data in 2010. Instead, there has been resounding silence. Not only has there been no evidence for SUSY, but many of the most promising scenarios where SUSY particles would solve the problem of the Higgs mass have been ruled out.\nAt the same time, many non-collider experiments designed to directly detect the kind of dark matter you’d see if it were made up of superpartners have come up empty. “The lack of evidence from both direct detection and the LHC is a really strong piece of information the field is still kind of digesting,” Kahn says.\nMany younger researchers—like Sam Homiller, a theorist at Harvard University—are less attached to the idea. “[SUSY] would have been a really pretty story,” says Homiller. “Since I came in after it … it’s just kind of like this interesting history.”\nSome theorists are now directing their search away from particle accelerators and toward other sources of hidden particles. Masha Baryakhtar, a theorist at the University of Washington, uses data from stars and black holes. “These objects are really high density, often high temperature. And so that means that they have a lot of energy to give up to create new particles,” Baryakhtar says. In their nuclear furnaces, stars might produce loads and loads of another dark matter candidate called the axion. There are experiments on Earth that aim to detect such particles as they reach us. But if a star is expending energy to create axions, there will also be telltale signs in astronomical observations. Baryakhtar hopes these celestial bodies will be a useful complement to detectors on Earth.\nOther researchers are finding ways to give new life to old ideas like SUSY. “I think SUSY is wonderful—the only thing that’s not wonderful is that we haven’t found it,” quips Karri DiPetrillo, an experimentalist at the University of Chicago. She points out that SUSY is far from being ruled out. In fact, some promising versions of SUSY that account for dark matter (but not the Higgs mass) are completely untested.\nAfter initial investigations did not find SUSY in the most obvious places, many researchers began looking for “long-lived particles” (LLPs), a generic class of potential particles that includes many possible superpartners. Because detectors are primarily designed to see particles that decay immediately, spotting LLPs challenges researchers to think creatively.\n“You need to know the details of the experiment that you’re working on in a really intimate way,” DiPetrillo says. “That’s the dream—to really be using your experiment and pushing it to the max.”\nThe two general-purpose detectors at the LHC, ATLAS and CMS, are a bit like onions, with concentric layers of particle-­tracking hardware. Most of the initial mess from proton collisions—jets and showers of quarks—decays immediately and gets absorbed by the inner layers of the onion. The outermost layer of the detector is designed to spot the clean, arcing paths of muons, which are heavier versions of electrons. If an LLP created in the collision made it to the muon tracker and then decayed, the particle trajectory would be bizarre, like a baseball hit from first base instead of home plate. A recent search by the CMS collaboration used this approach to search for LLPs but didn’t spot any evidence for them.\nResearchers scouring the data often don’t have any faith that any particular search will turn up new physics, but they feel a responsibility to search all the same. “We should do everything in our power to make sure we leave no stone unturned,” DiPetrillo says. “The worst thing about the LHC would be if we were producing SUSY particles and we didn’t find them.”\nNeedles in high-energy haystacks\nSearching for new particles isn’t just a matter of being creative with the hardware; it’s also a software problem. While it’s running, the LHC generates about a petabyte of collision data per second—a veritable firehose of information. Less than 1% of that gets saved, explains Ben Nachman, a data physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab: “We just can’t write a petabyte per second to tape right now.”\nDealing with that data will only become more important in the coming years as the LHC receives its “high luminosity” upgrade. Starting at the end of the decade, the HL-LHC will operate at the same energy, but it will record about 10 times more data than the LHC has accumulated so far. The boost will come from an increase in beam density: stuffing more protons into the same space leads to more collisions, which translates to more data. As the frame fills with dozens of collisions, the detector begins to look like a Jackson Pollock painting, with splashes of particles that are impossible to disentangle.\nTo handle the increasing data load and search for new physics, particle physicists are borrowing from other disciplines, like machine learning and math. “There’s a lot of room for creativity and exploration, and really just kind of thinking very broadly,” says Jessica Howard, a phenomenologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\nOne of Howard’s projects involves applying optimal transport theory, an area of mathematics concerned with moving stuff from one place to the next, to particle detection. (The field traces its roots to the 18th century, when the French mathematician Gaspard Monge was thinking about the optimal way to excavate earth and move it.) Conventionally, the “shape” of a particle collision—roughly, the angles at which the particles fly out—has been described by simple variables. But using tools from optimal transport theory, Howard hopes to help detectors be more sensitive to new kinds of particle decays that have unusual shapes, and better able to handle the HL-LHC’s higher rates of collisions.\nAs with many new approaches, there are doubts and kinks to work out. “It’s a really cute idea, but I have no idea what it’s useful for at the moment,” Nachman says of optimal transport theory. He is a proponent of novel machine-learning approaches, some of which he hopes will allow researchers to do entirely different kinds of searches and “look for patterns that we couldn’t have otherwise found.”\nThough particle physicists were early adopters and have been using machine learning since at least the early 1990s, the past decade of advances in deep learning has dramatically changed the landscape.\nPacking more power\nThe energy of particle colliders (as measured by the combined energy of two colliding particles) has risen over the decades, opening up new realms of physics to explore.\nCollisions between leptons , such as electrons and positrons, are efficient and precise, but limited in energy. Among potential future projects is the possibility of colliding muons, which would give a big jump in collision energy.\nCollisions between hadrons , such as protons and antiprotons, have high energy but limited precision. Although it would start with electrons (rightmost point), a possible Future Circular Collider could reach 100,000 (10 5 ) GeV by colliding protons.\n\n“[Machine learning] can almost always improve things,” says Javier Duarte, an experimentalist at the University of California, San Diego. In a hunt for needles in haystacks, the ability to change the signal-to-noise ratio is crucial. Unless physicists can figure out better ways to search, more data might not help much—it might just be more hay.\nOne of the most notable but understated applications for this kind of work is refining the picture of the Higgs. About 60% of the time, the Higgs boson decays into a pair of bottom quarks. Bottom quarks are tricky to find amid the mess of debris in the detectors, so researchers had to study the Higgs through its decays into an easy-to-spot photon pair, even though that happens only about 0.2% of the time. But in the span of a few years, machine learning has dramatically improved the efficiency of bottom-quark tagging, which allows researchers another way to measure the Higgs boson. “Ten years ago, people thought this was impossible,” Duarte says.\nThe Higgs boson is of central importance to physicists because it can tell them about the Higgs field, the phenomenon that gives mass to all the other elementary particles. Even though some properties of the Higgs boson have been well studied, like its mass, others—like the recursive way it interacts with itself—remain unknown with any kind of precision. Measuring those properties could rule out (or confirm) theories about dark matter and more.\nWhat’s truly exciting about machine learning is its potential for a completely different class of searches called anomaly detection. “The Higgs is kind of the last thing that was discovered where we really knew what we were looking for,” Duarte says. Researchers want to use machine learning to find things they don’t know to look for.\nIn anomaly detection, researchers don’t tell the algorithm what to look for. Instead, they give the algorithm data and tell it to describe the data in as few bits of information as possible. Currently, anomaly detection is still nascent and hasn’t resulted in any strong hints of new physics, but proponents are eager to try it out on data from the HL-LHC.\nBecause anomaly detection aims to find anything that is sufficiently out of place, physicists call this style of search “model agnostic”—it doesn’t depend on any real assumptions.\nNot everyone is fully on board. Some theorists worry that the approach will only yield more false alarms from the collider—more tentative blips in the data like “two-sigma bumps,” so named for their low level of statistical certainty. These are generally flukes that eventually disappear with more data and analysis. Koren is concerned that this will be even more the case with such an open-ended technique: “It seems they want to have a machine that finds more two-sigma bumps at the LHC.”\nNachman told me that he received a lot of pushback; he says one senior physicist told him, “If you don’t have a particular model in mind, you’re not doing physics.” Searches based on specific models, he says, have been amazingly productive—he points to the discovery of the Higgs boson as a prime example—but they don’t have to be the end of the story. “Let the data speak for themselves,” he says.\nBuilding bigger machines\nOne thing particle physicists would really like in the future is more precision. The problem with protons is that each one is actually a bundle of quarks. Smashing them together is like a subatomic food fight. Ramming indivisible particles like electrons (and their antiparticles, positrons) into one another results in much cleaner collisions, like the ones that take place on a pool table. Without the mess, researchers can make far more precise measurements of particles like the Higgs.\nAn electron-positron collider would produce so many Higgs bosons so cleanly that it’s often referred to as a “Higgs factory.” But there are currently no electron-­positron colliders that have anywhere near the energies needed to probe the Higgs. One possibility on the horizon is the Future Circular Collider (FCC). It would require digging an underground ring with a circumference of 55 miles (90 kilometers)—three times the size of the LHC—in Switzerland. That work would likely cost tens of billions of dollars, and the collider would not turn on until nearly 2050. There are two other proposals for nearer-term electron-positron colliders in China and Japan, but geopolitics and budgetary issues, respectively, make them less appealing prospects.\nPhysicists would also like to go to higher energies. “The strategy has literally never failed us,” Homiller says. “Every time we’ve gone to higher energy, we’ve discovered some new layer of nature.” It will be nearly impossible to do so with electrons; because they have such a low mass, they radiate away about a trillion times more energy than protons every time they loop around a collider. But under CERN’s plan, the FCC tunnel could be repurposed to collide protons at energies eight times what’s possible in the LHC—about 50 years from now. “It’s completely scientifically sound and great,” Homiller says. “I think that CERN should do it.”\nCould we get to higher energies faster? In December, the alliteratively named Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) put forward a vision for the near future of the field. In addition to addressing urgent priorities like continued funding for the HL-LHC upgrade and plans for telescopes to study the cosmos, P5 also recommended pursuing a “muon shot”—an ambitious plan to develop technology to collide muons.\nThe idea of a muon collider has tantalized physicists because of its potential to combine both high energies and—since the particles are indivisible—clean collisions. It seemed well out of reach until recently; muons decay in just 2.2 microseconds, which makes them extremely hard to work with. Over the past decade, however, researchers have made strides, showing that, among other things, it should be possible to manage the roiling cloud of energy caused by decaying muons as they’re accelerated around the machine. Advocates of a muon collider also tout its smaller size (10 miles), its faster timeline (optimistically, as early as 2045), and the possibility of a US site (specifically, Fermi National Laboratory, about 50 miles west of Chicago).\nThere are plenty of caveats: a muon collider still faces serious technical, financial, and political hurdles—and even if it is built, there is no guarantee it will discover hidden particles. But especially for younger physicists, the panel’s endorsement of muon collider R&D is more than just a policy recommendation; it is a bet on their future. “This is exactly what we were hoping for,” Homiller says. “This opens a pathway to having this exciting, totally different frontier of particle physics in the US.” It’s a frontier he and others are keen to explore.\nDan Garisto is a freelance physics journalist based in New York City.\nCorrection: The article was updated to better reflect how long particle physicists have been using machine learning.\nKeep Reading\nMost Popular\nIt’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot\nWe’re increasingly developing bonds with chatbots.

[ 2 ]\nSynopsis\nIn 1809, Thomasina Coverly, the daughter of the house, is a precocious teenager with ideas about mathematics, nature, and physics well ahead of her time. She studies with her tutor Septimus Hodge, a friend of Lord Byron (an unseen guest in the house). In the present, writer Hannah Jarvis and literature professor Bernard Nightingale converge on the house: she is investigating a hermit who once lived on the grounds ; he is researching a mysterious chapter in the life of Byron. As their studies unfold – with the help of Valentine Coverly, a post-graduate student in mathematical biology – the truth about what happened in Thomasina's time is gradually revealed.\nScene 1 (Act 1)\nThe play opens on 10 April 1809, in a garden-front room of the house. Septimus Hodge is trying to distract 13-year-old Thomasina from her curiosity about \" carnal embrace \" by challenging her to prove Fermat's Last Theorem ; he also wants to focus on reading the poem \"The Couch of Eros\" by Ezra Chater, who with his wife is a guest at the house. Thomasina starts asking why jam mixed in rice pudding can never be unstirred, which leads her to the topic of determinism and to a beginning theory about chaotic shapes in nature. This is interrupted by Chater himself, who is angry that his wife was caught in the aforementioned \"carnal embrace\" with Septimus; he has come to demand a duel . Septimus tries to defuse the situation by heaping praise on Chater's \"The Couch of Eros\". The tactic works, because Chater does not know it was Septimus who had savaged an earlier work of his, \"The Maid of Turkey\". Landscape architect Richard Noakes enters, shortly accompanied by Captain Brice and Lady Croom; the three discuss proposed modifications to the Arcadian style gardens, while Thomasina sketches an imaginary hermit on Noakes's technical drawing of the garden.\nScene 2\nThe present day. Hannah Jarvis is researching the house, the garden, and specifically the hermit, for a study of hermits and the Romantic imagination. Bernard Nightingale enters with Chloe Coverly; she conceals the professor's identity from Hannah, as Nightingale had given Hannah's last book a poor review. Chloe's brother, Valentine, is gathering data on the population biology of the grouse in the surrounding grounds, using the house's \"game books\". When Chloe accidentally reveals Bernard's identity, Hannah reacts angrily; but she agrees to share her research material. This  enables him to propose the theory that one of the 1809 inhabitants, Ezra Chater, was killed by Lord Byron in a duel. Bernard notes that records of Chater the poet disappeared after 1809, and the only other Chater of record is a botanist .\nScene 3\nThe 19th century.  Septimus is tutoring Thomasina, this time in translating Latin . Again their focus diverts, this time to the destruction of the Alexandrian Library , which upsets Thomasina.  She mourns the loss of the knowledge stored there, and Septimus responds that all that was lost will eventually turn up again. They are interrupted by Chater, who succeeds in challenging Septimus to a duel, having learned (from Lord Byron off-stage) that Septimus wrote the damning review of his work.\nScene 4\nThe present.  Hannah rediscovers Thomasina's primer containing her ideas on iteration and chaos theory ; this recalls Septimus' assertion that what was lost is eventually rediscovered. Valentine reacts with interest to the notes, as his own research centres on similar concepts.\nScene 5 (Act 2)\nBernard gives Hannah, Valentine, and Chloe a preview of his lecture theorising that Lord Byron shot and killed Chater in a duel. When Hannah and Valentine challenge his logic, Bernard launches into a diatribe about the irrelevance of science, then departs for his lecture (and a promotional media appearance) in London. Hannah begins to suspect that the hermit of Sidley Park – who was reportedly obsessed with algebraic computations about the heat death of the universe , the theory suggested in Thomasina's diagram – could have been Septimus.\nScene 6\nReturning to 1809, we learn that the duel never occurred. Instead, the Chater couple left for the West Indies with Captain Brice. Chater served as the expedition's botanist and his wife Charity was the captain's secret paramour . Lord Byron has also left the country. Septimus has gone rabbit hunting for Thomasina, who favours rabbit pie ; he returns to find Lady Croom searching for him. She has found two letters, a love letter addressed to her, and another to Thomasina about rice pudding, both written by Septimus in case he died in a duel. She invites Septimus to an amorous rendezvous.\nScene 7\nBoth 1812 and the present, the actions running concurrently. Some present-day characters are in fancy dress for a party, so that both casts appear similarly attired. After reading a newspaper report on the Byron murder theory, Chloe talks about determinism with Valentine, echoing the discussion between Septimus and Thomasina. Chloe, however, believes that sex is the force that disrupts the universe's ordered plan. Valentine, using his computer to extrapolate Thomasina's ideas, relates them to the later developed concept of entropy . He wonders whether Thomasina or Septimus was the genius behind the theories. Hannah and Valentine mention that Thomasina died in a fire on the eve of her seventeenth birthday.\nMeanwhile, Thomasina asks Septimus to teach her to dance, to prepare for her forthcoming 17th birthday party. Lady Croom enters, complaining to Noakes about the noise of his steam engine ; Thomasina notes that the machine obeys the laws of entropy (which have not yet been formalized ), which describe the universe as winding down. In the present, Bernard arrives and is met by Hannah, who has found a letter detailing the facts of Chater's death – this discovery totally discredits Bernard's theory and vindicates Lord Byron's reputation. While Septimus awaits appropriate music for Thomasina's dance lesson, he examines the sketch she made to illustrate the irreversibility of heat ; his action mirrors that of Hannah and Valentine, who pondered the same diagram. Bernard is caught in a compromising position with Chloe, and is asked to depart.\nEventually a waltz starts, and Septimus dances with Thomasina, revealing that their relationship is increasingly complicated by hints of romance. Gus (Valentine and Chloe's younger brother, who has been silent for the entire play) hands another of Thomasina's drawings to a surprised Hannah. It depicts Septimus and the tortoise, confirming her suspicion that the hermit, who had a tortoise called Plautus, was Septimus. After Thomasina's tragic death, he apparently became a hermit. Accepting her challenge to the laws of the universe as propounded by Newton , he worked for the rest of his life to apply \"honest English algebra\" to the question of the universe's future.\nCharacters\nCharacters of 1809\nThomasina Coverly: The 13-year-old (later 16-year-old) daughter of Lord and Lady Croom, Thomasina is a precocious genius. She comes to understand chaos theory and the second law of thermodynamics , before either is established in the mathematical and scientific communities. Stoppard \"apparently based\" [ 3 ] [ 4 ] the character on Lord Byron's daughter Ada Lovelace (Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace). She was an English mathematician who conceptualised how Charles Babbage 's Analytical engine could be used, foreseeing the binary computer. [ 5 ]\nSeptimus Hodge: Thomasina's tutor, and the academic colleague and friend of Lord Byron (an unseen but important character). While teaching Thomasina, he works on his own research and has affairs with the older women of the house. When Thomasina is older, he falls in love with her; after her death, he becomes the \"hermit of Sidley Park\", working on her theories until his own death.\nJellaby: The Crooms' butler. His chief functions are to spread gossip and to deliver letters.\nEzra Chater: An unsuccessful poetaster staying at Sidley Park. His wife's romantic affairs lead him to challenge Septimus to a duel. Later, it is revealed that he is the amateur botanist \"Mr. Chater,\" who dies of a monkey bite in Martinique , where he has travelled with his wife and Captain Brice.\nCharity Chater: Ezra Chater's wife. Though she, like Byron, never appears onstage, she plays a vital role. She sleeps with Septimus, and her repeatedly cuckolded husband challenges him to a duel. She sleeps with Lord Byron and gets him, Captain Brice, her husband and herself expelled from Sidley Park.\nRichard Noakes: Lady Croom's gardener. Throughout the play, he is working to transform Sidley Park's classical, Arcadia-like landscape into the popular Gothic style – which Lady Croom begrudgingly accepts. He is key in exposing Septimus's and Mrs. Chater's affair.\nLady Croom: Thomasina's mother.  She rules the Coverly estate with an iron fist, but flirts with Septimus and other gentlemen throughout the play. A second Lady Croom, the mother of Valentine, Chloe, and Gus in the modern half of the play, never appears on stage.\nCaptain Brice: The brother of Lady Croom (of 1809). He is a sea captain who falls in love with Mrs. Chater. He takes her and her husband to the West Indies at the end of the play. After Mr. Chater's death, Captain Brice marries the widowed Charity Chater.\nAugustus Coverly: Thomasina's trouble-making younger brother.  He appears in only a few brief scenes. (Gus and Augustus are played by the same actor.)\nCharacters of the present\nHannah Jarvis: The author of a best-seller on Byron's mistress Lady Caroline Lamb . Hannah is researching the elusive hermit of Sidley Park, said to have lived there in the early 19th century. Hannah collaborates (warily) with Bernard and also with Valentine, though she rejects the romantic advances of both.\nChloe Coverly: The 18-year-old daughter of the modern Lady Croom. While her mind is not as rigorous as Thomasina's, Chloe likes to propose wild ideas. She argues that the Newtonian universe has been destabilized by sex and the problems it causes. She tries to set up Hannah with Bernard, but ends up sleeping with him herself.\nBernard Nightingale: A don at a modern university in Sussex, England. Bernard comes to Sidley Park hoping to work with Hannah on his theory about Lord Byron staying at the estate. Instead of seeking further evidence, he announces on TV his theory that Lord Byron killed Ezra Chater in a duel. At the end of the play, Hannah proves him wrong, much to his chagrin.\nValentine Coverly: Chloe's older brother. A graduate student of mathematics, he pores over several old documents and comes to acknowledge Thomasina's genius.\nGus Coverly: Valentine and Chloe's younger brother, who has been mute since the age of five. Gus helps to pass several important props from past to present, and helps connect key moments in the play. (Gus and Augustus are played by the same actor.)\nGenre\nArcadia is, on the surface, somewhere between a tragedy and a comedy. It involves some elements of classical tragedy – \" noble \" characters and the audience's foreknowledge of Thomasina's death – but the predominant element is comedy, in the way that the characters interact with each other and in their witty, epigrammatic dialogue. [ 6 ]\nThemes\nArcadia explores the nature of evidence and truth in the context of modern ideas about history, mathematics, and physics [ citation needed ] . It shows how clues left by the past are interpreted in the present, by both laypeople and scholars. Stoppard has said that his initial inspiration came from reading James Gleick 's 1987 bestseller, Chaos: Making a New Science , \"which is about this new kind of mathematics. That sounds fairly daunting if one's talking about a play. I thought, here is a marvellous metaphor.\" [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Besides chaos, the play attends to a wide array of subjects, including thermodynamics , computer algorithms , fractals , population dynamics , determinism (especially in the context of love and death), classics , landscape design , Romanticism vs. Classicism , English literature (particularly poetry), Byron , 18th century periodicals , modern academia , and even South Pacific botany . These are all concrete topics of conversation; their more abstract resonances rise into epistemology , nihilism , and the origins of lust and madness .\nArcadia' s themes are presented in a series of dichotomies. Most prominent is chaos versus order. The play's characters and action embody this, moving from a settled social order, in which relationships arise, toward the final scene, where the social order – and even the separation of the two eras – dissolve in the party's chaos, relationships collapse, and the characters die or disperse. Yet within that chaos, order can still be found. As Valentine declares: \"In an ocean of ashes, islands of order. Patterns making themselves out of nothing.\" Although the play's world grows increasingly chaotic – with overlapping time periods, increasingly complex ideas, and ever greater variations in social norms and assumptions – connections and order can still be discerned. The characters attempt to find and articulate the order they perceive in their world, even as it is continually overturned.\nThe center-stage table that collects props from both time periods throughout the play is a vivid metaphor of the chaos/order dichotomy. As Paul Edwards, professor of English and History of Art at Bath Spa University , suggests:\nAt the end of the play, the table has accumulated a variety of objects that, if one saw them without having seen the play, would seem completely random and disordered. Entropy is high. But if one has seen the play, one has full information about the objects and the hidden 'order' of their arrangement, brought about by the performance itself. Entropy is low; this can be proved by reflecting that tomorrow night's performance of the play will finish with the table in a virtually identical 'disorder' – which therefore cannot really be disorder at all. [ 9 ]\nA closely related theme in Arcadia is the opposition of Classicism and Romanticism . This appears most clearly in the running arguments between Noakes and Lady Croom about proposed changes to the garden. Their disagreements are about changing from the tidy order of Classic style to the rugged naturalism and Gothic mystery of the Romantic. A parallel dichotomy is expressed by Septimus and Thomasina: He instructs her in the Newtonian vision of the universe, while she keeps posing questions and proposing theories that undercut it.  Hannah's search for the hermit of Sidley Park also touches on this theme. \"The whole Romantic sham!\" she passionately exclaims to Bernard. \"It's what happened to the Enlightenment, isn't it? A century of intellectual rigour turned in on itself. A mind in chaos suspected of genius ... The decline from thinking to feeling.\"\nAnother major theme is entropy and the irreversibility of time. Thomasina examines this scientifically, remarking that while Newtonian equations work both backwards and forwards, things in reality – like her rice pudding – cannot be \"unstirred.\" Heat, too, she notes, flows in only one direction (the second law of thermodynamics). This is embodied by the characters, who burn bridges in relationships, burn candles, and burn letters – and in the end, Thomasina herself (like a short-lived candle) burns to death.\nThomasina's insights into thermodynamics and heat transfer, and the idea that the universe is cooling, echo the poem \" Darkness \" by her \"real life\" contemporary, Lord Byron. [ 9 ] Written in 1816 – the \" Year Without a Summer \", caused by atmospheric ash from the volcano Mount Tambora erupting in the Dutch East Indies – \"Darkness\" depicts a world grown dark and cold because the sun has been extinguished.\nThe play's end brings all these dichotomous themes together, showing that while things may appear to contradict – Romanticism and Classicism, intuition and logic, thought and feeling – they can exist, paradoxically, in the same time and space. Order is found amid the chaos.\nStyle\nJim Hunter writes that Arcadia is a relatively realistic play, compared to Stoppard's other works, though the realism is \"much enhanced and teased about by the alternation of two eras\". [ 10 ] The setting and characters are true-to-life, without being archetypal. It is comprehensible : the plot is both logical and probable, following events in a linear fashion. Arcadia' s major deviation from realism, of course, is in having two plotlines that are linear and parallel. Thus we see Thomasina deriving her mathematical equations to describe the forms of nature; [ 11 ] we later see Val, with his computer, plotting them to produce the image of a leaf. [ 12 ]\nLanguage\nThe language of Arcadia switches between the colloquialisms of early 19th-century England and those of modern England. Stoppard's language reflects his periods, historical and modern, and he uses speech patterns and lexicons in keeping with his characters.\nBut his is a stylised dialogue, conveying the \"look and feel\" of the past as perceived by the modern audience. [ 13 ] Still, it has sufficient latitude in register to make plain the relationships between the characters. For example, Septimus, after failing to deflect a question from Thomasina with a joke, bluntly explains to his pupil the nature of \"carnal embrace\" [ 14 ] – but this bluntness is far removed from that with which he dismisses Chater's self-deceiving defence of his wife's reputation (which, Septimus says, \"could not be adequately defended with a platoon of musketry\"). With Lady Croom, in responding to his employer's description of Mrs. Chater as a \"harlot\", Septimus delicately admits that \"her passion is not as fixed\" as one might wish. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]\nIn the modern sequences, the dialogue is more realistic. [ 6 ] But Bernard consciously assumes some stylisation of language: He rehearses his public lecture in heightened, flamboyant rhetoric; [ 17 ] and he unleashes a polemic against Valentine's scientific thought (describing the concept as no more than \"performance art\"), not from spite but for \"recreation\". [ 18 ] [ 19 ]\nThe play's scientific concepts are set forth primarily in the historical scenes, where Thomasina delivers her precocious (or even anachronistic) references to entropy , the deterministic universe and iterated equations in improvised, colloquial terms. [ 9 ] In the modern era, Valentine explains the significance of Thomasina's rediscovered notebook with careful detail, reflecting Stoppard's research into his play's scientific materials. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]\nConsciously echoed phrases, across the time frames, help to unify the play. For example, Chloe asks Valentine if \"the future is all programmed like a computer\", and whether she is the first to think that theory discredited \"because of sex\". [ 22 ] Thomasina has been there before: \"If you could stop every atom in its position and direction ... you could write the formula for all the future,\" she tells Septimus, then adds, \"Am I the first person to have thought of this?\" [ 23 ] The difference is significant: Chloe's intuitive version allows for the effects of chaos , illustrating Stoppard's theme of the interdependence of science and art, and between professional and amateur thinking. [ 24 ]\nTitle\nThe play's title is abbreviated from its initial version: Et in Arcadia ego . [ 25 ] Arcadia refers to the pastoral ideal; the phrase literally translates, \"and in Arcadia I am\".  The tradition of placing a tomb in a pastoral idyll can be traced to Virgil's Eclogues , while the phrase first appears in Guercino's painting dated in 1618-1622. Both the image and the motto are commonly considered a memento mori , with the phrase being spoken by Death: \"I, too, am in Arcadia\". But the enigmatic phrase remains a subject of much academic discussion. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]\nLady Croom, enthusing about paintings of pretty landscapes, translates the phrase as \"Here I am in Arcadia!\" Thomasina drily comments, \"Yes Mama, if you would have it so\". Septimus notices; later, suspecting his pupil will appreciate the motto's true meaning, he offers the translation \"Even in Arcadia, there am I\". He is right – \"Oh, phooey to Death!\" she exclaims. [ 28 ] Although these brief exchanges are the only direct references in the play to its title, they presage the two main characters' fates: Thomasina's early death, and Septimus's voluntary exile from life. [ 25 ] Stoppard originally wanted to make this connection more explicit by using Et in Arcadia Ego for the title, but \"box office sense prevailed\". [ 25 ]\nIn a more obvious sense, the title also invokes the ideal of nature as an ordered paradise, while the estate's landscape steadily evolves into a more irregular form. This provides a recurring image of the different ways in which \"true nature\" can be understood, and a homely parallel to Thomasina's theoretical description of the natural world's structure and entropic decline using mathematics. [ 25 ]\nContextual information\nIn Arcadia , Stoppard presents his audience with several highly complex but fundamental mathematical and scientific concepts. He also uses these theories and ideas to illuminate relationships among his characters, adding to their poignancy.\nOne of the play's main thematic concepts is chaos theory . Paul Edwards, in his essay \"Science in Hapgood and Arcadia \", notes that \"chaos mathematics is about the recovery of information from apparently chaotic and random systems where entropy is high. [...] It is 'asymmetric' (unlike the equations of classical physics ), yet it finds regularities that prove to be the regularities of nature itself. Strikingly, this mathematics can generate patterns of amazing complexity, but it also has the power to generate seemingly natural or organic shapes that defeat Newtonian geometry. The promise, then, (however questionable it is in reality) is that information, and by extension, nature itself, can overcome the tendency to increase in entropy\". [ 29 ] John Fleming, in his book Stoppard's Theatre: Finding Order amid Chaos , makes a similar observation. \"Deterministic chaos\", he writes, \"deals with systems of unpredictable determinism. ... [T]he uncertainty does not result in pure randomness, but rather in complex patterns. Traditionally, scientists expected dynamic systems to settle into stable, predictable behavior.\"  But as systems respond to variations in input, they become more random or chaotic. \"Surprisingly, within these random states, windows of order reappear. [...] There is order in chaos – an unpredictable order, but a determined order nonetheless, and not merely random behavior.\" [ 30 ]\nClosely related scientific and mathematical concepts in Arcadia are the second law of thermodynamics and entropy . Fleming describes these two principles. \"Entropy is the measure of the randomness or disorder of a system. The law of increase of entropy states that as a whole, the universe is evolving from order to disorder. This relates to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that heat spontaneously flows in only one direction, from hotter to colder. Since these equations, unlike Newton's laws of motion , do not go backward and forward, there is an ' arrow of time ' that points toward the eventual 'heat death' of the universe.\" [ 31 ]\nIn Arcadia , Stoppard uses all these concepts to reveal that \"there is an underlying order to seemingly random events.\" The characters discuss these topics, while their interactions reflect them. Often these discussions themselves create order and connections beneath the appearance of disunity. For example, both Thomasina's theories on heat and Valentine's search for a \"signal\" in the \"noise\" of the local grouse population refer to the physicist Joseph Fourier and his development of the Fourier transform , which he first used to analyze the physics of heat transfer but has since found wide application. Though the characters would seem to have little in common, their work in fact relates to the same topic. [ 32 ]\nSome ideas in the play recall Goethe 's novella Elective Affinities : Stoppard's characters \"Thomasina\" and \"Septimus\" have parallels in Goethe's \"Ottilie\" and \"Eduard\", and the historical section of Stoppard's play is set in 1809, the year of Goethe's novella. [ 33 ] Among other parallels, the older work takes the theory of affinity between chemical elements as a metaphor for ineluctable, inevitable \"human chemistry\" in the same way as Stoppard makes use of the force of determinism acting on his characters. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] A feature of both works is the preoccupation with remodelling country house landscapes; Goethe's young character \"Ottilie\" (the counterpart to Thomasina) dies as an indirect result of this. [ 33 ]\nProductions\nArcadia first opened at the Royal National Theatre in London on 13 April 1993, in a production directed by Trevor Nunn with Rufus Sewell as Septimus Hodge, [ 36 ] Felicity Kendal as Hannah Jarvis, Bill Nighy as Bernard Nightingale, Emma Fielding as Thomasina Coverly, Allan Mitchell as Jellaby, [ 37 ] Derek Hutchinson as Ezra Chater, Sidney Livingstone as Richard Noakes, [ 38 ] Harriet Walter as Lady Croom, Graham Sinclair as Captain Brice, Harriet Harrison as Chloe Coverly, Timothy Matthews as Augustus and Gus Coverly and Samuel West as Valentine Coverly. It won the 1993 Olivier and Evening Standard Awards for Best Play. [ 39 ]\nThe first New York production opened in March 1995, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater . [ 40 ] It was again directed by Trevor Nunn , but with an entirely new cast. It starred Billy Crudup as Septimus, Blair Brown as Hannah, Victor Garber as Bernard, Robert Sean Leonard as Valentine and Jennifer Dundas as Thomasina. This production was the Broadway debut of Paul Giamatti , who played Ezra Chater. The other actors were Lisa Banes (Lady Croom), Richard Clarke (Jellaby), John Griffin (Gus/Augustus), Peter Maloney (Noakes), David Manis (Captain Brice, RN) and Haviland Morris (Chloe). This production won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, and was nominated for the 1995 Tony Award for Best Play, losing to Terrence McNally 's Love! Valour! Compassion! .\nIn December 1996, the first major US regional production was mounted at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C. [ 41 ]\nOn 27 May 2009, a London production, directed by David Leveaux , opened at the Duke of York's Theatre starring Dan Stevens (Septimus Hodge), Samantha Bond (Hannah Jarvis), Jessie Cave (Thomasina Coverly), Nancy Carroll (Lady Croom), Trevor Cooper (Richard Noakes), Sam Cox (Jellaby), Lucy Griffiths (Chloë Coverly), Tom Hodgkins (Captain Brice), Hugh Mitchell (Augustus/Gus Coverly), Neil Pearson (Bernard Nightingale), George Potts (Ezra Chater) and Ed Stoppard (Valentine Coverly). The production recouped its costs and closed on 12 September 2009. [ 42 ]\nArcadia returned to Broadway, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre , on 17 March 2011, again directed by David Leveaux. The cast included Margaret Colin (Lady Croom), Billy Crudup (Septimus in the original Broadway version, now playing Bernard Nightingale), Raúl Esparza (Valentine Coverly), Glenn Fleshler (Captain Brice), Grace Gummer (Chloë Coverly), Edward James Hyland (Jellaby), Byron Jennings (Richard Noakes), Bel Powley (Thomasina Coverly), Tom Riley (Septimus Hodge), Noah Robbins (Gus Coverly/Augustus Coverly), David Turner (Ezra Chater), and Lia Williams (Hannah Jarvis). [ 43 ] The production was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play . [ 44 ]\nReception\nThe Times , reviewing the first production in 1993, praised it as a \"perfect marriage of ideas and high comedy\". [ 45 ] But for some, the ideas overwhelmed the comedy: \"[T]oo clever by about two-and-three-quarters,\" noted critic Jack Tinker . \"One comes away instructed with more than one can usefully wish to know.\" [ 46 ] After an eight-month run at the National, the play's transfer to the West End gave an opportunity for re-appraisal. The Daily Telegraph critic commented: \"I have never left a play more convinced that I had just witnessed a masterpiece\". [ 47 ]\nVincent Canby of The New York Times described the play as \"Tom Stoppard's richest, most ravishing comedy to date, a play of wit, intellect, language, brio and, new for him, emotion\". [ 40 ] But other New York reviews were mixed or unfavourable, complaining of the anachronisms and lack of realism. [ 48 ] The production left John Simon of New York Magazine with the view that \"Stoppard overdoes it… Arcadia makes better reading than seeing\". [ 49 ] The book review website The Pequod rated the play a 10.0 (out of 10.0), saying \" Arcadia combines an astonishing range of disparate elements — romance, humor, tragedy, sorrow, scientific history, and even gardening — into an entirely unique work of art.\" [ 50 ]\nThe 2009 London revival prompted more critics to laud the play as \"Stoppard's finest work\". [ 51 ] Michael Billington wrote in The Guardian that the play \"gets richer with each viewing. ... [T]here is poetry and passion behind the mathematics and metaphysics.\" [ 52 ] Johann Hari of The Independent speculated that Arcadia would be recognised \"as the greatest play of its time\". [ 53 ]\nThe 2011 Broadway staging met with a mixed reception. Ben Brantley of The New York Times called the production \"a half-terrific revival of Mr. Stoppard's entirely terrific Arcadia \", noting that \"several central roles are slightly miscast\", and \"some of the performances from the Anglo-American cast are pitched to the point of incoherence.\" [ 54 ] Similar concerns were raised by critics from the New York magazine, The Hollywood Reporter , The Wall Street Journal , New York Daily News , Time Out New York and Bloomberg News . [ 55 ]\nAwards and nominations\n1993 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play\n1995 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play\n1995 Tony Award for Best Play\n2006 Arcadia was voted onto the shortlist for the Royal Institution award for \"the best science book ever written\". The winner, announced on 19 October 2006, was The Periodic Table by Primo Levi .

Image Credit: Anna Dröfn Daníelsdóttir, Freyr Jóhannsson, Soffía Jónsdóttir, Sindri Jarlsson, Jón Pétur Gunnarsson & Ronan M. T. Fleming from the University of Iceland.\nBuilding on earlier pioneering work by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, an international consortium of university researchers has produced the most comprehensive virtual reconstruction of human metabolism to date. Scientists could use the model, known as Recon 2, to identify causes of and new treatments for diseases like cancer, diabetes and even psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Each person’s metabolism, which represents the conversion of food sources into energy and the assembly of molecules, is determined by genetics, environment and nutrition.\nThe researchers presented Recon 2 in a paper published online March 3 in the journal Nature Biotechnology .\nDoctors have long recognized the importance of metabolic imbalances as an underlying cause of disease, but scientists have been ramping up their research on the connection as a result of compelling evidence enabled by the Human Genome Project and advances in systems biology, which leverages the power of high-powered computing to build vast interactive databases of biological information.\n“Recon 2 allows biomedical researchers to study the human metabolic network with more precision than was ever previously possible. This is essential to understanding where and how specific metabolic pathways go off track to create disease,” said Bernhard Palsson, Galletti Professor of Bioengineering at UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering.\n“It’s like having the coordinates of all the cars in town, but no street map. Without this tool, we don’t know why people are moving the way they are,” said Palsson.\nHe likened Recon 2 to Google mapping for its ability to merge complex details into a single, interactive map. For example, researchers looking at how metabolism sets the stage for cancerous tumor growth could zoom in on the “map” for finely detailed images of individual metabolic reactions or zoom out to look at patterns and relationships among pathways or different sectors of metabolism. This is not unlike how you can get a street view of a single house or zoom out to see how the house fits into the whole neighborhood, city, state, country and globe.  And just as Google maps brings together a broad set of data – such as images, addresses, streets and traffic flow – into an easily navigated tool, Recon 2 pulls together a vast compendium of data from published literature and existing models of metabolic processes.\nResearchers liken Recon 2 to Google mapping for its ability to merge complex details into a single, interactive map. For example, researchers looking at how metabolism sets the stage for cancerous tumor growth could zoom in on the “map” for finely detailed images of individual metabolic reactions or zoom out to look at patterns and relationships among pathways or different sectors of metabolism. Image Credit: Anna Dröfn Daníelsdóttir, Freyr Jóhannsson, Soffía Jónsdóttir, Sindri Jarlsson, Jón Pétur Gunnarsson & Ronan M. T. Fleming from the University of Iceland.\nAs a multi-scale representation of the human metabolic network, Recon 2 provides essential context for data being reviewed by researchers. Palsson and other scientists in the field have already successfully demonstrated the utility of such models in simple organisms such as yeast and E.coli. As a result, they have been able to engineer these organisms in the lab to improve the efficiency of ethanol production and predict drug resistance in bacteria.\nOne of the most promising applications for the network reconstruction is the ability to identify specific gene expressions and their metabolic pathways for targeted drug delivery. Large gene expression databases are available for human cells that have been treated with molecules extracted from existing drugs as well as drugs that are in development. Recon 2 allows researchers to use this existing gene expression data and knowledge of the entire metabolic network to figure how certain drugs would affect specific metabolic pathways found to create the conditions for cancerous cell growth, for example. They could then conduct virtual experiments to see whether the drug can fix the metabolic imbalance causing the disease.\nPalsson’s Systems Biology Research Group at UC San Diego built the first virtual reconstruction of the human metabolism network, known as Recon 1 , in 2007 with a six-person team.  It featured more than 3,300 known biochemical reactions documented in over 50 years of metabolic research. Recon 2, which contains more than 7,400 reactions, was built by bringing together researchers from dozens of institutions around the globe in a series of “jamboree” meetings to refine and consolidate the data used in the reconstruction. Palsson said this jamboree approach helped the group establish common standards to build a consensus reconstruction, simplify its usability for biomedical researchers, and increase its transparency. Recon 2 will facilitate many future biomedical studies and is freely available at http://humanmetabolism.org .\nRecon 2 is already proving its utility, according to Ines Thiele, a professor at the University of Iceland and UC San Diego alumna, who led the Recon 2 effort. Thiele earned her Ph.D. in bioinformatics as a student of Palsson’s and was part of the original Recon 1 team. Several other UC San Diego alumni, and former Palsson students, participated in the consortium from their new institutions, including Neema Jamshidi (Ph.D., 2008, M.D., 2009), who is now interning at UCLA; Jason Papin (Ph.D., 2004), a professor at the University of Virginia; and Nathan Price (Ph.D., 2005), who is a professor at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Wash.\nThiele said Recon 2 has successfully predicted alterations in metabolism that are currently used to diagnose certain inherited metabolic diseases.\n“The use of this foundational resource will undoubtedly lead to a myriad of exciting predictions that will accelerate the translation of basic experimental results into clinical applications,” said Thiele. “Ultimately, I envision it being used to personalize diagnosis and treatment to meet the needs of individual patients. In the future, this capability could enable doctors to develop virtual models of their patients’ individual metabolic networks and identify the most efficacious treatment for various diseases including diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.”\nAs much as Recon 2 marks a significant improvement over Recon 1, there is still much work to be done, according to the research team.

CRISPR are DNA regions in the prokaryote genome consisting of identical short repeats (30–40 bp) separated by unique spacer sequences of the same length; CRISPR-associated Cas proteins are located in the vicinity of these regions (Hille and Charpentier, 2016). Short palindromic repeats are quite common: CRISPR regions are found in the genomes of 50% of all known bacteria and 90% of archaea (Grissa et al., 2007; Hille et al., 2018); this may indicate their extreme importance for prokaryotes. In 2020, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on development of the CRISPR/Cas system for genome editing.\nCRISPR/Cas research has progressed from the discovery of unusual and inexplicable repeats found by researchers in the genomes of various bacteria and archaea to the description of CRISPR/Cas involvement in prokaryotic acquired immunity and the use of this knowledge for targeted eukaryotic genome editing and other aims. Using CRISPR/Cas-based tools, researchers made breakthroughs in clinical trials and biotechnology companies have launched gene therapy trials for a range of diseases. The technology continues to develop rapidly, with great promise for further work in biology, medicine, bioengineering, biochemistry and other sciences. This review describes the history of CRISPR/Cas discovery and the use of the CRISPR/Cas technique for fundamental and applied research.\nDISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT \nOF THE CRISPR/Cas METHOD \nFOR GENOME EDITING\nThe first unusual repetitive sequences were described in 1987 in the genome of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) by a group of Japanese scientists led by Yoshizumi Ishino, who discovered that the 3' end of the gene Iap , whose products are responsible for the isoenzymatic conversion of alkaline phosphatase, contained “five highly homologous sequences of 29 nucleotides arranged as direct repeats with 32 nucleotides as spacing” (Ishino et al., 1987). They found no biological explanation for the presence and function of these repeats, and this work did not receive much attention from colleagues either: until 2007, Ishino’s publication was cited 1–2 times a year.\nThe unusual repetitive sequences in prokaryotic genomes interested the Spanish researcher Francisco Mojica, who discovered them in the genome of the archaea Haloferax mediterranei in 1993 (Mojica et al., 1993); at that time, the scientist was only 30 years old. In 1995, Mojica and co-authors described in detail these “tandem repeats” as they called them, in the genomes of Haloferax mediterranei and H. volcanii : a 30 bp sequence with dyad symmetry repeated in tandem with insertions of unique sequences of 33–39 bp and extending over long stretches, 1.4 kb in the H. mediterranei chromosome and ~3 kb in the H. volcanii chromosome (Mojica et al., 1995). To understand the role of this DNA region, the Mojica’s group decided to introduce an extra copy of this DNA region into H. volcanii by transformation with a recombinant plasmid containing a 1.1 bp fragment of tandem repeats. This resulted in a significant decrease of cell viability and unequal distribution of the genome among daughter cells (Mojica et al., 1995). The first hypothesis about the biological role of tandem repeats in prokaryotic genomes proposed their participation in the chromosome segregation during mitosis. Around the same time, similar repeats were described in the genomes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Groenen et al., 1993), Streptococcus (Hoe et al., 1999), cyanobacteria Anabaena sp. (Masepohlet al., 1996), Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium (Nakata et al., 1989) and other bacterial species. It has been proposed that these repeats might be involved in chromosomal rearrangements, recombination, or were landing sites for regulatory proteins (Nakata et al., 1989; Groenen et al., 1993), but these assumptions were not tested experimentally.\nAfter defending his PhD thesis in 1995, Francisco Mojica worked as a postdoc at Oxford University and then, driven by his interest in cryptic repeats, he returned to Spain where he tried to set up his own research group to study “tandem repeats.” At the time, he could not obtain research grants and was severely restricted in funding his work and building the infrastructure of his own laboratory (Mojica and Rodriguez-Valera, 2016). Despite the difficulties, the scientist continued his research. Mojica refocused on E. coli as a model organism, but reproduction of the experiments he had conducted earlier on H. volcanii did not yield the expected results: no clear phenotype of E. coli genome segregation defects was observed when an additional copy of the “tandem repeat” was introduced into its genome. Mojica’s second hypothesis was that tandem repeats served as reference points for DNA binding to cellular structures (e.g. cell membrane proteins or soluble proteins). However, no repeat-binding proteins were found in E. coli cell extracts. The third assumption was that the repeats could affect the three-dimensional structure of DNA, but this was not confirmed: analysis of plasmid DNA showed that the introduction of the repeat arrays had no effect on its topology (Mojica and Rodriguez-Valera, 2016).\nFrancisco Mojica did not give up on his ambition to find the functions of the mystery repeats. Gradual advances in sequencing technology made it easier to find such structures in the genomes of other organisms and Mojica’s colleague, César Díez-Villaseñor, created software to search for repetitive regions in prokaryote genomes. By 2000, Mojica’s lab systematized the data on genomic repeats in 9 species of archaea and 10 species of bacteria and gave them a name: Short Regularly Spaced Repeats (SRSR; an acronym that also indicates alternation of spacers and repeats, because it can also be decoded as: Spacer-Repeat-Spacer-Repeat) (Mojica et al., 2000). This highly important work for science was published in a MicroCorrespondence two-page format (a consolation to modern scientists who are asked to shorten their papers by journal editors).\nThe group of Dutch microbiologist Ruud Jansen, who described tandem repeats in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other prokaryotic species, named them SPIDR (SPacers Interspersed Direct Repeats) (Jansen et al., 2002a). To avoid further confusion in the rapidly growing subject, Mojica and Jansen jointly decided to replace the names: direct repeats, tandem repeats, SRSR, SPIDR and other variations of the names, with a simple, “crispy” (as R. Jansen himself aptly put it) and the name we know today, CRISPR ( Fig. 1 ). In 2002, Jansen and colleagues also identified protein-coding genes located in the vicinity of the repeat loci which they named as CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins (Jansen et al., 2002b).\nEmail sent by R. Jansen to F. Mojica regarding the name of regularly spaced CRISPR repeats. Source: Mojica and Garrett, 2013.\nAlthough the role of genomic repeats remained a mystery to scientists at that time, the widespread distribution of repeat sequences in various prokaryote species indicated their undoubted importance and fundamental cellular role. Having discovered Cas proteins, Jansen suggested that they were involved in DNA metabolism or regulation of gene expression in a genomic region functionally related to the CRISPR locus, as they had a structure similar to DNA helicases or exonucleases (Jansen et al., 2002b).\nHowever, the final key to unraveling the functions of the CRISPR/Cas system was the discovery of the origin of unique intermediate spacers. The role of these sequences has long been a mystery. Francisco Mojica initially did not give them much importance, he wrote: “the name itself (spacer) hints at an irrelevant role in the repeats just separating the palindromes” (Mojica and Rodriguez-Valera, 2016). In the early 2000s, his research group continued to work on CRISPR repeats in E. coli . They routinely amplified CRISPR loci using PCR, sequenced them and compared them with sequences in publicly available nucleotide databases. And then one day the scientists were lucky: one of the queries yielded a matching sequence, they found that the sequence of the spacer is homologous to a piece of the genome of the E. coli bacteriophage. Gradually, Mojica accumulated data on other spacers that had similarities to sequences in bacteriophages or in conjugative plasmids (Mojica et al., 2005). It turned out that bacteriophages whose sequences were found in CRISPR spacers were unable to infect a spacer host cell but infected closely related strains lacking this spacer (Mojica et al., 2005). An eureka moment occurred and Mojica was the first to make the correct assumption that the role of the CRISPR system is to acquire immunity against foreign DNA and that the locus itself is a “compartment for storing DNA chunks of invaders” (Mojica et al., 2005; Mojica and Rodriguez-Valera, 2016). It is worth mentioning again the difficulties of recognition that the authors of this revolutionary discovery encountered when trying to publish their findings (Lander, 2016). We cite these facts not in order to disappoint the reader in the objectivity of modern scientific publishing houses, although this would not be unreasonable in this case, but rather to console those scientists to whom this story gives hope of subsequent recognition of their work regardless of the initially negative reaction of the scientific community to their discovery. Realizing the importance of his scientific conclusion, Mojica submitted his article to Nature . In November 2003, the editors of Nature rejected the paper without even sending it to the reviewers: for unknown reasons, the editor stated that the idea for the paper was already known. In January 2004, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) also decided that the paper lacked the ‘novelty and importance’ to send it for review. Molecular Microbiology and Nucleic Acids Research were the next journals to reject Mojica’s manuscript. Desperate and worried that he may be outrun, Mojica sent the article to the Journal of Molecular Evolution where after a year (!) of reviews the article was finally published on February 1, 2005. Mojica recalled this period as follows: “Imagine you have something you know it’s big in your hands and there’s the possibility that another article that takes the originality of your work is published. I remember sending mail every month to the editor, saying ‘please tell me if you’re going to publish or not so we can submit to another journal’. I was in absolute despair” (Fernández, 2019).\nIn March and August 2005, two independent research groups from France described similar findings in Yersinia pestis and Streptococcus (Bolotin et al., 2005; Pourcel et al., 2005). The study of such an unusual model organism, Y. pestis , the causative agent of plague, was explained by the fact that the research group, headed by Gilles Vergnaud, was commissioned by the French Ministry of Defense and was developing methods to trace the source of potential biological weapons. Their unique collection of Y. pestis was obtained during the 1964–1966 Vietnam plague outbreak (Lander, 2016). Similarly to Mojica, Vergnaud faced the reluctance of journals to publish the patterns found: his paper was rejected by PNAS , Journal of Bacteriology , Nucleic Acids Research and Genome Research before finally being published in Microbiology on March 1, 2005.\nThe second French research group included our former compatriots, Alexander Bolotin and Alexei Sorokin, who studied streptococci in Paris. According to Sergei Kiselev, professor of the Vavilov Institute of General Genetics recalls, Bolotin “was approached by a large yogurt company at the time with a request to find out why they were no longer able to kill unwanted bacteria in the sourdough. Producers always used special viruses to suppress their life activity, but at some point bacteriophages stopped killing bacteria” (Vedeneeva, 2020). Bolotin was the first to describe the now famous Streptococcus nuclease Cas9 protein which was named Сas5 or Сsn1 at that time (Bolotin et al., 2005). In the course of their work, Bolotin and collaborators noticed that the spacers had a common sequence at the end: the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) necessary for target recognition (Bolotin et al., 2005).\nInterestingly, both the biological weapons and yogurt studies led to similar scientific conclusions. Both groups confirmed Mojica’s hypothesis on the role of CRISPR in the formation of acquired immunity in bacteria. In 2006, a group of US researchers (from ex-USSR), Kira S. Makarova, Nick V. Grishin, Svetlana A. Shabalina, Yuri I. Wolf, Eugene V. Koonin analyzed all prokaryotic genomes available at that time and found several gene clusters corresponding to Cas proteins (Makarova et al., 2006). The researchers classified Cas into protein families and described their potential functional and structural features. Assuming that the CRISPR/Cas immune defense system operates on the principle of RNA interference, they analyzed the similarity of Cas proteins to proteins of the RNA interference system, but found no similarities. They nevertheless made a number of assumptions about the mechanism of CRISPR/Cas operation and how new spacers can be acquired.\nWithout direct experimental confirmation, these findings only supported the hypothesis but did not prove it unequivocally. However, the proof of the beautiful hypothesis of acquired immunity in prokaryotes did not wait long: in 2007 Philip Horvath’s group in France demonstrated that after virus infection, bacteria integrated new spacers derived from phage genomic sequences; and removing or adding certain spacers modified prokaryotic cell phage resistance (Barrangou et al., 2007). They showed that Cas9 was a key protein required for the process by which the CRISPR system inactivated the invading phage (Barrangou et al., 2007). Once again, the discovery was facilitated by a request from the food industry: the authors of the article were at the time working for Danish food ingredient manufacturer Danisco (now DuPont) and were sequencing the genomes of bacteria used as starter cultures in the dairy industry to produce yogurt and cheese. They also sequenced bacteriophages that infect and destroy dairy cultures (Nair, 2017). Remarkably, since 2011 DuPont yogurt and cheese cultures have been ‘vaccinated’ against bacteriophages naturally using CRISPR (Nair, 2017). In 2008, John van der Oost’s group, together with Kira S. Makarova and Eugene V. Kunin showed that it is the small RNA (CRISPR RNA, crRNA) transcribed from the CRISPR locus that binds to Cas proteins and guides towards the target DNA for immune protection (Brouns et al., 2008). The same year, Luciano Marraffini and Eric Sontheimer described the defense mechanism of bacteria against plasmid DNA (Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008). They elegantly demonstrated that the target molecule of Cas proteins is DNA and not RNA. They were also the first to suggest that the CRISPR/Cas system could be used outside bacteria as a molecular tool: “From a practical point of view, the ability to direct specific targeted degradation of DNA containing any given target sequence of 24–48 nucleotides can have significant functional utility, especially if the system can function outside its native bacterial or archaeal context…. The main difference between a restriction-modification system and CRISPR interference is that the latter can be programmed with a suitable effector crRNA” (Marraffini and Sontheimer, 2008).\nNow the CRISPR topic has finally received the attention it deserved. New discoveries have appeared with snowballing speed: S. Moineau’s group (Garneau et al., 2010) found that the Cas-crRNA complex cuts foreign DNA 3 nucleotides above the PAM; K.S. Makarova and colleagues developed a classification of CRISPR/Cas systems (Makarova et al., 2011); Francisco Mojica in 2010 described in detail how the E. coli CRISPR system is turned on and off and suggested a mechanism of the system (Mojica and Díez-Villaseñor, 2010). The final solution to the puzzle of the CRISPR/Cas9-driven natural immunity mechanism was found in 2011 by Emmanuelle Charpentier’s group: in addition to sgRNA, there was a second small RNA, which the authors called transactivating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA). The latter was discovered by next-generation sequencing, the benefit of tracrRNA being the third most abundant transcriptome after rRNA and tRNA. Researchers showed that tracrRNA formed a duplex with sgRNA and it is this duplex that directed Cas9 to its DNA targets (Deltcheva et al., 2011).\nOnce the mechanism of CRISPR/Cas was finally decrypted, the scientific research immediately switched to the practical application of this system, as scientists understood the enormous potential of the discovered mechanism. The study of CRISPR/Cas began to take place away from the host bacteria: the CRISPR/Cas was used as a targeted tool for targeted DNA cutting. In 2011, Lithuanian biochemist Virginijus Šikšnis, a graduate student in chemistry at Moscow State University, was able to transfer a functional CRISPR/Cas from S. thermophilus and express it in E. coli . This confirmed that the CRISPR/Cas system is capable of working autonomously and all its necessary elements (Cas9, crRNA and tracrRNA) were already known (Sapranauskas et al., 2011). In 2012, his group characterised the structure of Cas9 in detail, identified its nuclease domains, showed that crRNA can be shortened to 20 nucleotides, and that Cas9 targets could be changed by replacing crRNA (Gasiunas et al., 2012). The authors showed that the Cas9/crRNA/tracrRNA complex can cleave target DNA in vitro. Šikšnis submitted his paper to Cell on April 6, 2012, and the journal rejected the paper without peer review six days later, then he sent it to PNAS on May 21, where it was published on September 4 (Lander, 2016).\nA technological breakthrough was provided by Emmanuelle Charpentier (E. Charpentier) and Jennifer A. Doudna, who reported that crRNA and tracrRNA can be combined together to form a single synthetic guide RNA (sgRNA); this is currently the technology used by researchers who now need only two elements to program the targeted cutting of DNA: a Cas9 nuclease and a single guide RNA that guides the nuclease (Jinek et al., 2012). Like Šikšnis, Charpentier and Doudna demonstrated that Cas9 could cut purified DNA in vitro, and that the latter could be programmed by specially designed sgRNAs. Their work was submitted to Science on June 8 and published on June  28, 2012. Around the same time, Doudna filed a patent application for the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system.\nFinally, in 2013, Feng Zhang, who had previously worked on TALEN (transcription activator-like effectors) programmable nucleases, was the first to successfully adapt CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing in eukaryotic cells (Cong et al., 2013). He applied CRISPR/Cas9 to target editing of different genome loci in human and murine cells (Cong et al., 2013). Around the same time, similar results were published by George M. Church’s laboratory (Mali et al., 2013). After publication, Feng Zhang also applied for a patent in his own name and was able to obtain one before Doudna.\nNOBEL PRIZE\nCRISPR is considered nowadays the most important discovery in molecular biology since PCR, entailing the creation of the latest and most successful genetic engineering technology. Understanding the importance of this discovery, researchers and people interested in science have been wondering when the Nobel Prize for CRISPR/Cas would be awarded. Many feared that the technology was expected to make some sort of practical advance in order to finally be awarded the prize.\nThe 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry went to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna for developing the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique. Firstly, this is of course a choice in favor of applied rather than basic science, as if the prize had been awarded for the discovery of CRISPR/Cas, it would certainly have been worth celebrating the merits of Francisco Mojica. Nevertheless, the wording of the Nobel Committee unequivocally speaks specifically of “method development.” Secondly, a maximum of three people can be awarded the Nobel Prize for a single discovery, and awarding it to the two female researchers Charpentier and Doudna can be regarded as a kind of statement of the Nobel Committee. Before the award, part of the scientific community thought it would go to Charpentier, Doudna and Zhang (less frequently Šikšnis was named third), as those who had made major contributions to the application of CRISPR/Cas for genome editing in vitro and in vivo, in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.\nOverall, in the era of collectivism in science, the justification of awarding Nobel Prizes to two or three people is increasingly questioned, as many discoveries are the achievement of a dozen scientists and their research teams.\nCURRENT DEVELOPMENTS \nUSING CRISPR/Cas\nOne of the industrial sectors most interested in CRISPR/Cas is agriculture. Targeted editing of plant genomes is actively used to increase yields in fruit and grain crops, give them resistance to disease and changing weather conditions, and other desirable traits. For example, editing genes related to cytokine signaling has significantly increased yields in rice and wheat (Cong et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014). Mutation of CLV (Rodríguez-Leal et al., 2017) and ENO (Yuste-Lisbona et al., 2020) genes responsible for meristem size has increased tomato yields. Using CRISPR/Cas technology, a variety of wheat with a reduced gluten content and 85% less immunogenicity has been created as it is important for people with celiac disease to control their dietary intake of gluten in wheat products. This result would have been almost impossible to achieve by classical crossbreeding methods, as gluten group proteins are scattered in about a hundred loci in the wheat genome (Sánchez-León et al., 2018).\nMost genetically modified plants are still under development and are not used for mass cultivation, but there are many exceptions. By now, more than a hundred CRISPR/Cas-derived plant varieties have been officially approved. These include, for example, soybean with increased oleic acid content due to a mutation in the omega-6 fatty acid desaturase gene and wheat that is resistant to powdery mildew by editing the MLO gene locus that suppresses the plant’s defense mechanisms against fungal infections (Wang et al., 2014).\nAnother promising area for the use of CRISPR/Cas in living organisms is editing the genomes of vectors of infectious and parasitic diseases to reduce their populations, or their ability to transmit a particular disease: for example, research is ongoing to induce sterility in malaria mosquitoes, which could lead to a significant reduction in malaria vector populations (North et al., 2020). This approach could help control disease transmission and protect ecosystems from species that are dangerous to humans.\nGenetic engineering using CRISPR/Cas also offers unique medical applications; for example, the use of CRISPR/Cas technology solves transplant compatibility problems and other problems associated with the use of porcine organs in humans. These include the problem of porcine endogenous retroviruses pathological to humans. George Church’s lab successfully applied CRISPR/Cas9 to inactivate all 62 copies of retroviruses in pig cells (Yang et al., 2015); this incidentally set a record for the number of modified loci in a single experiment.\nMuhammad Mohiuddin form the University of Maryland, USA is working on immunocompatibility problems between pig organs and the human body in heart xenotransplant. His group has created pigs with a knockout of three genes responsible for carbohydrate antigen synthesis and human rejection of the pig heart ( GGTA1KO, β 4GalNT2KO, CMAHKO ), a growth hormone receptor gene ( GHR ) knockout to inhibit pig heart growth in the human body, and the addition of six human genes: two anti-inflammatory ( hCD47, hHO-1 ), two genes that promote normal blood clotting ( hTBM, hEPCR ), and two complement system regulator genes ( hCD46, hDAF ) (Goerlich et al., 2021). Heart transplant from genetically modified pigs has been tested in baboons and has shown good results (Goerlich et al., 2021). Thanks to the work of Mohiuddin’s team, the high-profile achievement of this year was the world’s first heart transplant of a genetically modified pig to a human on January 7, 2022 by M. Mohiuddin’s team (Reardon, 2022; Jee, 2022).\nIn 2021, the results of ex vivo clinical trials using CRISPR/Cas9 in human cells were published. Haydar Frangoul’s group performed haematopoietic stem cell editing to knockout the BCL11A enhancer in two patients with sickle cell anaemia and β-thalassaemia (monogenic diseases caused by mutations in the gene encoding the β-subunit of haemoglobin) (Frangoul et al., 2021). BCL11A is a repressor of haemoglobin γ‑subunit (HbF) and its knockout results in increased HbF expression, which increases survival in patients with sickle cell anaemia and β-thalassaemia. Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation of ex vivo corrected cells resulted in an increase in blood HbF concentration and relief of disease symptoms (Kaiser, 2020; Frangoul et al., 2021).\nCurrently, research on the CRISPR/Cas technology develops in several directions, including the development of effective ways to deliver CRISPR/Cas components into cells (as DNA, RNA or ribonucleoproteins) using biological (viruses, virus-like particles, cellular penetration peptides), chemical (liposomes, nanoparticles) and physical methods (electroporation, sonoporation, microinjection) (Taha et al., 2022); as well as the development of approaches aimed at improving the on-target and reducing the off-target mutagenic activity of Cas proteins (Nidhi et al., 2021). To minimize off-target editing, various software programs are being developed aimed at in silico prediction of off-target activity and selection of optimal and specific sgRNAs; chemically modified sgRNAs with higher specificity are used; improved variants of Cas are selected and constructed (Naeem et al., 2020).\nA number of scientific groups in Russia are actively engaged in CRISPR/Cas research. Konstantin Severinov’s laboratory from SkolTech is engaged in the prediction and functional characterisation of the new CRISPR-Cas system. Sergey Shmakov from this team has created a semi-automated search system that detects novel CRISPR/Cas systems (Shmakov et al., 2019). Using this software, members of Severinov’s laboratory found and characterized the C2c2 protein (now Cas13a), unique in that it cuts RNA rather than DNA (Abudayyeh et al., 2016). Yana Fedorova from the same laboratory described a compact Cas9 orthologue with all the same functional features but reduced in size, making it easier to deliver to cells (Fedorova et al., 2020). Suren Zakiyan’s Epigenetics of Development Laboratory from the Institute of Cytology and Genetics in Novosibirsk is successfully working on the creation of cellular models of various human neurodegenerative diseases (Medvedev et al., 2021), muscular dystrophies (Medvedev et al., 2021), including Huntington’s disease (Morozova et al., 2018; Malankhanova et al., 2020), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Ustyantseva et al., 2019), and spinal muscular atrophy (Valetdinova et al., 2017) using CRISPR/Cas9 system. Maxim Karagyaur from the Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine, Moscow State University has been using the CRISPR/Cas technology to knockout genes of interest, to regulate gene expression at the epigenetic level, to model single-nucleotide polymorphisms to create cellular and tissue models to study tissue development and regeneration (Karagyaur et al., 2018; Rysenkova et al., 2018; Tyurin-Kuzmin et al., 2018; Dyikanov et al., 2019; Slobodkina et al., 2020; Rusanov et al., 2020). Other interesting works by Russian scientists include the development of a method for rapid sorting of cells with genetic modifications after CRISPR/Cas9 action based on a short peptide expression (Zotova et al., 2019) and the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to simultaneously create double-stranded breaks in different chromosomal locations to study the mechanisms of chromosomal translocations (Shmakova et al., 2019; Canoy and Vassetzky, 2021). Thus, the use of CRISPR/Cas genome editing technology in various fields and in different organisms, provides unique industrial and medical opportunities to improve the quality of life.\nUSING CRISPR/Cas \nTO EDIT GERMLINE DNA\nSince the CRISPR/Cas system is a convenient tool for genome editing, almost immediately after the description of its use in eukaryotic cells, studies began on the possibility of its application to human embryos, both for the correction of pathological mutations and for fundamental studies of early human embryonic development. The effectiveness of this approach, off-target mutagenicity, the editing efficacy (embryo mosaicism), and the possibility of subsequent embryo development have been studied (Ormond et al., 2017; Lea and Niakan, 2019). The sources of embryos in such works were unclaimed embryos from in vitro fertilisation procedures (Fogarty et al., 2017). It appears that knockout models in mice do not always accurately reflect the role of the genes under study in human embryonic development (Fogarty et al., 2017). Despite many attempts, accurate targeted editing of embryos (through DNA repair by homologous recombination mechanism) remains low, with deletions or insertions occurring after double-strand breaks in most cases, while mechanisms of early embryonic DNA repair remain poorly understood (Ma et al., 2017). For this reason, the use of CRISPR/Cas to correct pathological mutations in embryos is difficult. At the same time, the use of CRISPR/Cas for targeted mutagenesis and gene knockout also poses certain risks: apparently, double-stranded breaks introduced by Cas9 at a single locus result in deletions that can extend over several thousand bases, including in embryonic and progenitor cells (Kosicki et al., 2018).\nDespite significant progress in the field, there are a number of concerns about the clinical use of CRISPR/Cas in humans: questions about both the safety of the method and the ethics of its application are increasingly being raised. A precedent has been set in the case of He Jiankui, a researcher at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen (China), who used CRISPR/Cas to modify the genome of human embryos. Providing in vitro fertilisation services, He Jiankui’s group suggested that a couple in which the husband was infected with HIV should make a genetic modification to the CCR5 gene in the embryos that would lead to the cells being resistant to HIV infection (Regalado, 2019). The natural CCR5Δ32 mutation is found in Europe and Western Asia, where its average frequency is around 10%, and homozygotes for the mutant allele do have resistance to HIV (Novembre et al., 2005; Lopalco, 2010). According to He Jiankui, who announced his experiment in November 2018, the genome editing was successful and resulted in the birth of healthy twin girls Lulu and Nana (Cyranoski and Ledford, 2018). It is worth noting that neither the plan nor the results of this work have been fully published or peer-reviewed by the scientific community. On November 29, 2018, Chinese authorities suspended He Jiankui’s scientific activities and he was prosecuted for violating Chinese laws on human experimentation and for providing unlicensed medical care; in December 2019, the scientist was sentenced to three years in prison and a fine of three million yuan.\nHe Jiankui, in an attempt to publish the results of his high-profile experiment, submitted an article titled “Twin births after genome editing for HIV resistance” to Nature and JAMA , both journals rejected the article (Regalado, 2019). Interestingly, He Jiankui’s co-authors included Michael Deem, a scientist at Rice University (Houston, USA). Despite claims that he did not consent to the publication of the data, an internal review was initiated against Deem, the results of which are classified, but as of 2021 he is no longer employed by Rice University.\nHe Jiankui’s study has been heavily criticised by scientists for several reasons:\n(1) The claims made in the article were not supported by the data provided. Although the article stated that they were trying to replicate a frequent variant of the CCR5Δ32 mutation, in fact they were not: other mutations have been introduced into the CCR5 gene, whose role in providing HIV resistance had not even been studied in vitro. The never-published article did not provide evidence that the genetic manipulation did lead to HIV resistance, although this could have been tested before the embryos were implanted. Moreover, analysing the sequencing data cited in the article, one could see an extended region of multiple uninterpretable peaks in the sequencing data of the CCR5 gene (Regalado, 2019), suggesting that the embryos were mosaic, i.e. different cells had different mutations in this region, whose role was also unexplored.\n(2) The parents of the twins may have been poorly informed about the nature of the experiment or may have agreed to the experiment under pressure. There are established protocols for in vitro fertilisation in HIV+ parents that reduce the risks of infection to the embryo or foetus to zero. In this regard, the genome modification procedure offered no medical benefit but introduced unnecessary risks that the couple may not have been aware of. Moreover, in China, HIV-positive people do not have access to fertility treatment and in vitro fertilisation, indicating that the couple may have been forced to experiment because it gave them the only chance of having a child.\n(3) The claimed medical benefit of CCR5 deletion is questionable. Even if CRISPR is effective in making people resistant to HIV, it is unlikely to be widely used, especially in places where HIV epidemics are unfolding, such as southern Africa, due to its complexity, cost, need for constant monitoring and a variety of other reasons. It will probably take many decades of widespread use of genetic editing using CRISPR (assuming it is effective) to halt the HIV epidemic. Public health initiatives, education and widespread access to antiretrovirals are more logical and effective solutions to control the HIV epidemic.\n(4) The side-effects of applying human genome editing are poorly understood and researchers led by He Jiankui have begun creating genetically modified live humans before they have fully grasped the implications of their edits. CRISPR/Cas technology is not 100% specific to a given gene and the insertion of a nuclease with sgRNA can lead to off-target mutations elsewhere in the genome. He Jiankui’s team tested selected 3–5 cells from embryos at an early stage before implantation for off-target mutations and found a single nucleotide insertion in a non-coding region of the genome in one embryo. A key problem here, however, is that sequencing for mutations involves lysing the cells and isolating the DNA, meaning that the cells tested cannot be further used for fertilisation and may be different from the embryo from which they were taken. Conversely, embryos that gave rise to twins could not be fully screened for off-target mutations in each of the cells. For example, the use of CRISPR/Cas9 on sheep embryos together with preimplantation screening and selection of embryos with the desired mutation nevertheless leads to mosaicism in half of the fetuses (Vilarino et al., 2018). A recent study applying CRISPR/Cas9 to correct the EYS gene in human embryos found that on-target and off-target cutting of Cas9 can lead to complete or partial chromosomal losses (Zuccaro et al., 2020).\nIn conclusion, it must be reiterated that the genetic modification of human embryos should be regarded as a high-risk procedure and the mass introduction of CRISPR/Cas technology will require legislation to ensure that the technology is not used in violation of ethical rules.\nIn addition to editing of the human embryo genome, one can edit human germline cells (sperm and egg cells). The introduction of CRISPR/Cas9 into oocytes together with spermatogonial cells (as part of in vitro fertilization) has been proposed to improve editing efficiency and reduce the risk of embryo mosaicism (Ma et al., 2017), although there are rather few experimental developments in human germ cell editing. Genetic modification of spermatogonial stem cells has been tested in mice (Wu et al., 2015) and pigs (Webster et al., 2021).\nEthical and social guidelines regarding clinical editing of the human embryonic genome have been set out by the American National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine and the English Nuffield Council on Bioethics (National Academies of Sciences, 2017; Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2018). In 2019, a call for a global moratorium on clinical use of germline DNA editing (in sperm, eggs or embryos) to create genetically modified children on technological, scientific, medical and ethical grounds was published by several leading scientists, including Emmanuel Charpentier, Eric Lander and Feng Zhang (Lander et al., 2019). In 2020, the Geneva Statement on the need for a course correction in the editing of the human inherited genome was issued (Andorno et al., 2020). Its authors insist that a global public consensus is required before any steps towards reproductive editing of the human genome can be initiated. The authors have included an explanation to the general public about the current misunderstandings surrounding genome editing, the mainstreaming of social issues, including equity, and the development of criteria for empowering the public to influence decision-making in this area.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUntil 20 years ago, the CRISPR/Cas system was only known to a narrow circle of scientists working on the subject. The mysterious system of repeats and spacers was of interest only to a few microbiologists working with bacteria or archaea and did not seem like a major scientific breakthrough. Today, the technique has become the subject of intense scrutiny by the entire scientific community, including both specialists and historians of science, philosophers discussing ethical issues that have arisen, as well as the general public. CRISPR/Cas studies are actively receiving grant support, and articles are willingly published on it. It is worth remembering that only the undying interest of the discoverers (especially Francisco Mojica) has brought us to the level of knowledge where we are today.\nResearchers in almost every biochemistry, molecular biology or cytology lab now use CRISPR/Cas for genome editing. The rapid development of the technique has brought society to a turning point: the possibility of editing human genomes has opened up before us. Nevertheless, the risks also exist. Is the technology completely safe for humans because of possible off-target effects? How can possible criminal and anti-human use of the technique be ruled out? The inability to test the side effects of CRISPR/Cas at the early stages of embryonic development raises an important moral and ethical issue: who will be responsible if a child is born with genetic abnormalities?\nOther pressing questions arise: can CRISPR/Cas be used for non-lethal, treatable diseases? Can CRISPR/Cas be used at a population level? Will the introduction of this cutting-edge and expensive technology further divide the poor from the rich, giving the latter more advantages? Finally, could CRISPR/Cas be used en masse to “improve” human genetics?\nIt would seem that not so long ago, fantasy literature described how human phenotypic traits could be altered on demand, right down to the choice of eye or hair colour. Now it seems that this possibility is much less fantastic. But while eye and hair colour are polygenic traits that are difficult or even impossible to change using CRISPR/Cas, editing single genes seems like a solvable scientific task. The precedent of editing the CCR5 gene has caused deep reflection among an informed public, because in addition to the described resistance to HIV, the CCR5 mutation has been associated with improved memory and learning ability (Zhou et al., 2016). Will prospective parents want to improve the cognitive abilities of their unborn children through genome editing? All these important questions remain to be answered in the near future, and it is best to do so before embarking on human genome editing.\nREFERENCES\nBarrangou, R., Fremaux, C., Deveau, H., et al., CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes, Science , 2007, vol. 315, no. 5819, pp. 1709–1712.

The ASL-3 Security Standard involves increased internal security measures that make it harder to steal model weights, while the corresponding Deployment Standard covers a narrowly targeted set of deployment measures designed to limit the risk of Claude being misused specifically for the development or acquisition of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons. These measures should not lead Claude to refuse queries except on a very narrow set of topics.\n\nWe are deploying Claude Opus 4 with our ASL-3 measures as a precautionary and provisional action. To be clear, we have not yet determined whether Claude Opus 4 has definitively passed the Capabilities Threshold that requires ASL-3 protections. Rather, due to continued improvements in CBRN-related knowledge and capabilities, we have determined that clearly ruling out ASL-3 risks is not possible for Claude Opus 4 in the way it was for every previous model, and more detailed study is required to conclusively assess the model’s level of risk. (We have ruled out that Claude Opus 4 needs the ASL-4 Standard, as required by our RSP, and, similarly, we have ruled out that Claude Sonnet 4 needs the ASL-3 Standard.)\n\nDangerous capability evaluations of AI models are inherently challenging , and as models approach our thresholds of concern, it takes longer to determine their status. Proactively enabling a higher standard of safety and security simplifies model releases while allowing us to learn from experience by iteratively improving our defenses and reducing their impact on users.\nThis post and the accompanying report discuss the new measures and the rationale behind them.\n\nBackground\nIncreasingly capable AI models warrant increasingly strong deployment and security protections. This principle is core to Anthropic’s Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP). 1\nDeployment measures target specific categories of misuse; in particular, our RSP focuses on reducing the risk that models could be misused for attacks with the most dangerous categories of weapons–CBRN.\nSecurity controls aim to prevent the theft of model weights–the essence of the AI’s intelligence and capability.\nAnthropic’s RSP includes Capability Thresholds for models: if models reach those thresholds (or if we have not yet determined that they are sufficiently far below them), we are required to implement a higher level of AI Safety Level Standards . Until now, all our models have been deployed under the baseline protections of the AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) Standard. ASL-2 deployment measures include training models to refuse dangerous CBRN-related requests. ASL-2 security measures include defenses against opportunistic attempts to steal the weights. The ASL-3 Standard requires a higher level of defense against both deployment and security threats, suitable against sophisticated non-state attackers.\nRationale\nWe have not yet determined whether Claude Opus 4 capabilities actually require the protections of the ASL-3 Standard. So why did we implement those protections now? We anticipated that we might do this when we launched our last model, Claude Sonnet 3.7. In that case, we determined that the model did not require the protections of the ASL-3 Standard. But we acknowledged the very real possibility that given the pace of progress, near future models might warrant these enhanced measures. 2 And indeed, in the lead up to releasing Claude Opus 4, we proactively decided to launch it under the ASL-3 Standard. This approach allowed us to focus on developing, testing, and refining these protections before we needed them.\nThis approach is also consistent with the RSP, which allows us to err on the side of caution and deploy a model under a higher standard than we are sure is needed. In this case, that meant proactively carrying out the ASL-3 Security and Deployment Standards (and ruling out the need for even more advanced protections). We will continue to evaluate Claude Opus 4’s CBRN capabilities. If we conclude that Claude Opus 4 has not surpassed the relevant Capability Threshold, then we may remove or adjust the ASL-3 protections.\nDeployment Measures\nThe new ASL-3 deployment measures are narrowly focused on preventing the model from assisting with CBRN-weapons related tasks of concern, 3 and specifically from assisting with extended, end-to-end CBRN workflows in a way that is additive to what is already possible without large language models. This includes limiting universal jailbreaks —systematic attacks that allow attackers to circumvent our guardrails and consistently extract long chains of workflow-enhancing CBRN-related information. Consistent with our underlying threat models, ASL-3 deployment measures do not aim to address issues unrelated to CBRN, to defend against non-universal jailbreaks, or to prevent the extraction of commonly available single pieces of information, such as the answer to, “What is the chemical formula for sarin?” (although they may incidentally prevent this). Given the evolving threat landscape, we expect that new jailbreaks will be discovered and that we will need to rapidly iterate and improve our systems over time.\nWe have developed a three-part approach: making the system more difficult to jailbreak, detecting jailbreaks when they do occur, and iteratively improving our defenses.\nMaking the system more difficult to jailbreak. We have implemented Constitutional Classifiers —a system where real-time classifier guards, trained on synthetic data representing harmful and harmless CBRN-related prompts and completions, monitor model inputs and outputs and intervene to block a narrow class of harmful CBRN information. Our pre-production testing suggests we can substantially reduce jailbreaking success while adding only moderate compute overhead (additional processing costs beyond what is required for model inference) to normal operations.\nDetecting jailbreaks when they occur. We have also instituted a wider monitoring system including a bug bounty program focused on stress-testing our Constitutional Classifiers, offline classification systems, and threat intelligence partnerships to quickly identify and respond to potential universal jailbreaks that would enable CBRN misuse.\nIteratively improving our defenses. We believe we can rapidly remediate jailbreaks using methods including generating synthetic jailbreaks that resemble those we discovered and using those data to train a new classifier.\nAll these measures will require ongoing refinement, both to improve their effectiveness and because they may still occasionally affect legitimate queries (that is, they may produce false positives). 4 Nevertheless, they represent a substantial advance in defending against catastrophic misuse of AI capabilities. 5\nSecurity\nOur targeted security controls are focused on protecting model weights—the critical numerical parameters that, if compromised, could allow users to access our models without deployment protections. Our approach involves more than 100 different security controls that combine preventive controls with detection mechanisms, primarily targeting threats from sophisticated non-state actors 6 from initial entry points through lateral movement to final extraction. Many of these controls, such as two-party authorization for model weight access, enhanced change management protocols, and endpoint software controls through binary allowlisting, are examples of following the best practices established by other security-conscious organizations.\n\nOne control in particular, however, is more unique to the goal of protecting model weights: we have implemented preliminary egress bandwidth controls. Egress bandwidth controls restrict the flow of data out of secure computing environments where AI model weights reside. The combined weights of a model are substantial in size. By limiting the rate of outbound network traffic, these controls can leverage model weight size to create a security advantage. When potential exfiltration of model weights is detected through unusual bandwidth usage, security systems can block the suspicious traffic. Over time, we expect to get to the point where rate limits are low enough that exfiltrating model weights before being detected is very difficult—even if an attacker has otherwise significantly compromised our systems. Implementing egress bandwidth controls has been a forcing function to understand and govern the way in which data is flowing outside of our internal systems, which has yielded benefits for our detection and response capabilities.\n\nAs with the deployment protections, we are continuing to work on improving the coverage and maturity of our security controls, always taking into account the evolving threat landscape. In particular, we will continue improving our egress controls, mitigations against more sophisticated insider threats, and our overall security posture.\nConclusions\nAs we have emphasized above, the question of which deployment and security measures to apply to frontier AI models is far from solved. We will continue to introspect, iterate, and improve. The practical experience of operating under the ASL-3 Standards will help us uncover new and perhaps unexpected issues and opportunities.\nWe will continually work with others in the AI industry, users of Claude, and partners in government and civil society to improve our methods of guarding these models. We hope that our detailed report will be of use to others in the AI industry attempting to implement similar protections and help us all prepare for the promise and challenge of even more capable AI.\nRead the full report .\nFootnotes\n1 The RSP is only one component of our approach to mitigating potential risks.\n2 In particular, we had some evidence of improved CBRN-related capabilities. Experiments showed that access to Claude Sonnet 3.7 helped participants do somewhat better on tasks related to CBRN weapon acquisition than those with standard internet access (although all participants’ plans still had critical failures). Model performance on evaluations like the Virology Capabilities Test had been steadily increasing over time.\n3 Initially they are focused exclusively on biological weapons as we believe these account for the vast majority of the risk, although we are evaluating a potential expansion in scope to some other CBRN threats.\n4 We have also established access control systems so that users with dual-use science and technology applications may be vetted to receive targeted exemptions from some classifier actions.\n5 For more information on our assessment of the effectiveness and sufficiency of these measures, see the ASL-3 Deployment Safeguards Report .\n6 Nation-state threats (other than those using non-novel attack chains) and sophisticated insider risk are out of the scope of the ASL-3 Standard.\n\nNews\nHow enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "4371c166f26b1b9a42e134a8187a29beccd70585732b0b0285eee97038d54051", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 2808, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 25178, "ratings": []}

How was this possible?\nBy: Sophie Ochmann , Saloni Dattani , and Max Roser\nThis article was first published in June 2018, and we updated the text in February 2024.\nSmallpox is the only human disease that has been successfully eradicated. 1\nIt is an infectious disease caused by the variola virus, and was a major cause of mortality in the past, with historic records of outbreaks across the world. Its historic death tolls were so large that it is often likened to the bubonic plague.\nThe eradication of smallpox is therefore a major success story for global health. It was a disease that was endemic across all continents and caused major mortality worldwide, and addressing it led to crucial advances in the field of immunology. The smallpox vaccine was the first vaccine to be developed.\nSee all interactive charts on smallpox ↓\nRelated topics\nEradication of Diseases\nWhich ones could we eradicate in our lifetimes and how?\nChild and Infant Mortality\nChild mortality remains one of the world’s largest problems and is a painful reminder of work yet to be done. With global data on where, when, and how child deaths occur, we can accelerate efforts to prevent them.\nOther research and writing on smallpox on Our World in Data:\nWhy are there differences between reported and estimated cases of smallpox?\nSmallpox: disease, transmission & symptoms\nWhat is smallpox?\nSmallpox is an infectious disease that is caused by the variola virus. It spreads from one person to another, either directly or indirectly. The variola virus infects only humans — other animals are unable to catch smallpox.\nThere are two types of variola viruses — variola major and variola minor — with the former type being much more severe and deadly.\nHow is it transmitted?\nPeople can be infected with the variola virus if they inhale droplets, or come into contact with droplets, containing the virus from someone who is infected with it. Coughing and sneezing, for example, can lead to the virus being spread through droplets. 2\nSymptoms\nThe classic symptom of smallpox is the rash — these are pustules covering a patient's entire body. After being infected with the variola virus, patients usually have no symptoms for 10–14 days (which is called the incubation period) followed by symptoms like a fever and headache — which resemble a common cold — for 2–3 days. Since these symptoms are not specific to smallpox, it can be very difficult to tell from symptoms alone that they have been infected. 3\nOn average, it then takes 24 hours for the rash to cover the body, and an additional three weeks for them to grow in size, form crusts, and eventually fall off. A surviving patient would be marked for life with depigmented skin and scars in places where pustules had formed.\nAge profile of patients\nSmallpox could infect people of any age. However, in societies where it was endemic, it mainly affected children. Adults in an endemic population would have been infected with the virus at an earlier stage in their lives already and since the only two possible outcomes of an infection were death or survival and life-long immunity, the virus could only infect and be transmitted by individuals that had never been exposed before: children.\nIn 17th century Britain, this led to children not being considered full members of the family until they had survived their smallpox infection. 4\nDeath\nAmong people known to be infected with the variola major virus, around 30% are estimated to have died. In contrast, an infection of the variola minor virus was milder — it would lead to death in less than one percent of cases. 5\nThe specific way a smallpox infection would lead to a patient's death remains unclear. 2 The Oxford Textbook of Medicine notes that people infected may develop symptoms of prostration (total exhaustion), toxemia (toxins in the blood), and hypotension (low blood pressure), which all contribute, but the mechanism by which smallpox causes such symptoms are not clear. 6\nAmong those who died from smallpox, death usually occurred within 10 to 16 days of the beginning of their symptoms. 7\nPatients who successfully fought off the infection and survived, would likely never catch smallpox again. 8 They would develop long-lasting immunity to the disease, through the production of memory cells that could quickly detect and activate killer cells against variola viruses that they encountered in the future.\nLack of treatment\nWhile smallpox was endemic, there was never a treatment for it. Once a person was infected, it wasn’t possible to treat them — one could only helplessly let the disease run its course and hope they survived.\nModern antiviral drugs might now allow treatment of the disease if the disease still existed — the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 9 now lists three antiviral drugs as potential treatment options.\nOrigins of smallpox\nThe origin of the variola virus and the time since when it infected humans are uncertain.\nClassic symptoms of smallpox — the skin eruptions and pustules — have been identified in mummified individuals dating back to 1100–1500 BCE in Egypt. 10\nOne of these was Pharaoh Ramses V who died in 1157 BCE. The photograph of his skull below shows small pustules, especially on his cheeks. 11\nThe origins and evolution of smallpox have been explored further using paleogenomic evidence, which involves sequencing ancient genomes from mummified individuals and other samples from burials, and analyzing them to see how closely related they are and when they likely shared a common genetic ancestor. 13\nThe first ancient genome, extracted from a 400-year-old Lithuanian child, suggested that the major divergence between modern variola virus strains occurred within the last two centuries. 14\nBut four other genomes, from Viking-era samples dating from 600 to 1050 CE, were later discovered, and analyses of these samples suggested that the divergence actually occurred around 1700 years ago. They also revealed an extinct lineage, which suggested that smallpox was more widely spread across Europe than historical records suggested. 15\nAncient DNA has been important in our understanding of smallpox's evolutionary history, but genomic analysis in dating the virus's origins and evolution can still be challenging.\nOne reason is that, when vaccination first emerged it led to significant evolutionary pressure on the variola virus, and caused some of its strains to go extinct. Another reason is that we may not have uncovered a wide enough diversity of ancient samples yet. These factors can skew genetic estimates, and complicate efforts to understand when the virus actually emerged. 16 They also highlight the need for further research to better understand the origins and history of the variola virus.\nEmpirical View\nHow many died of smallpox?\nDonald Henderson — who directed the WHO’s program to eradicate smallpox worldwide — reports that, during the 20th century alone, \"an estimated 300 million people died of the disease\" in his review paper “The eradication of smallpox — An overview of the past, present, and future”. 17\nHe also suggests that in the last hundred years of its existence smallpox killed “at least half a billion people.” 18 Over a century, this translates to around 5 million annual deaths on average.\nLong-run smallpox deaths in Europe\nThe graph shows the death rate over the long run in some European countries. The data spans the period from 1774 to 1900 in European countries for which data was available.\nTwo phenomena are illustrated here.\nFirst, Swedish data, which pre-dates the smallpox vaccine in 1796, shows the large disease burden and endemicity of smallpox in the 18th century. In peak years, up to 7 out of 1000 people in Sweden died of smallpox, and the endemic disease had volatile outbreaks.\nSecond, countries that had adopted vaccination legislation earlier saw their smallpox death rates decline more substantially and suffered fewer casualties during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871.\nAustria and Belgium — neither of which ever made smallpox vaccination mandatory — still recorded large numbers of smallpox deaths from 1875 onwards, while other European countries had already driven down smallpox fatalities significantly by then.\nEven so, smallpox remained endemic in every European country at the end of the 19th century.\nNumber of smallpox cases\nSmallpox cases by country\nThe chart depicts the reported number of smallpox cases by most countries between 1920 and 1977.\nYou can see that, by the time the World Health Organization (WHO) launched its Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program in 1966, most countries in Western Europe and North America had almost eliminated smallpox.\nHowever, countries across South America, Africa, and Asia, especially India, still recorded very large numbers — note the large differences in the color brackets below.\nGlobal decline of smallpox\nGlobal data on the number of smallpox cases is shown in the chart. Shown here is the number of reported smallpox cases worldwide from 1920 until the last case in 1977.\nThe reported number of smallpox cases between 1920 and 1978 amounted to 11.6 million cases — but that number was certainly smaller than the actual number of cases, although we do not know by how much.\nEven though smallpox was easily visible and should therefore be relatively easy to document, there was not an international organization dedicated to collating this data before then, which means the number of reported cases could be substantially lower than the actual number of cases.\nCrosby (1993) estimates that in 1967, 10–15 million people were still being infected with smallpox every year. In contrast, the chart on the reported cases below indicates only 132,000 for that same year. 19\nRead more in our article:\nWhy are there differences between reported and estimated cases of smallpox?\nHistorical cases of smallpox were underreported to authorities. What was the extent of underreporting, and how do researchers adjust for this?\nSmallpox decline by region\nThe chart below shows the number of reported cases, broken down by world region, until 1977, the year of the last case of smallpox.\nEven though absolute numbers are almost certainly far too low (as explained above), it can be seen that South Asia had by far the highest number of smallpox cases.\nThis was primarily driven by incidence in India: in 1973, for instance, in a state that had reported approximately 500 cases a week, the WHO search team found that there were actually 10,000 cases. 20\nEradication of smallpox\nThe last variola major infection was recorded in Bangladesh in October 1975, while the last variola minor infection occurred two years later in Merka, Somalia, on October 26th, 1977.\nDuring the following two years, WHO teams searched the African continent for further smallpox cases among people with rash-like symptoms, which can be a symptom of several diseases. They found no further cases of smallpox.\nIn 1978, a laboratory accident in the United Kingdom occurred where a variola virus sample was spread through the university laboratory's ventilation system, infecting two people and killing one. 21\nThe world map shows the year in which each country recorded the last endemic case of smallpox. As you can see, Europe, North America and Australia managed to eliminate smallpox relatively early, most by the 1940s. This predated the WHO's Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program, which was launched in 1966.\nCountries across Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia eliminated smallpox several decades later, in the 1960s and 1970s.\nIn May 1980, the World Health Assembly, the governing body of the World Health Organization, officially certified the global elimination of smallpox, the first-ever eradication of a disease in human history.\nIt further \"recommended that all countries cease vaccination, all laboratories should destroy their remaining stocks or transfer them\" to one of two certified high-security laboratories. One was in the Vector Institute in Siberia and another was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. 22\nThese are the only two known places that still hold samples of the variola viruses for research purposes.\nHow was global decline & eradication achieved?\nVariolation\nDiscovery of variolation\nProgress against smallpox began with variolation, which refers to deliberately infecting people with weakened or milder versions of the smallpox virus. It is sometimes also inoculation.\nBefore the year 1000, people in India and China had already observed that children who survived smallpox infections were protected against any future outbreaks of the disease. As a consequence, they developed a procedure that involved the nasal inhalation of dried smallpox scabs by three-year-olds. 2\nAnother commonly practiced technique, whose origins are unknown, involved injecting the liquid from pustules of a smallpox patient into a healthy person, underneath their skin. This would usually result in a milder infection of smallpox, and the person would then develop immunity against the disease.\nBoth practices became known as variolation (inoculation) techniques.\nHowever, there were disadvantages of variolation. One was that, during the course of the mild infection, the person became a carrier of the disease and could infect other people. Additionally, it was difficult to control the severity of the infection — it could sometimes develop into a full-blown smallpox case that could lead to death. 23\nThis meant that the practice usually reduced the severity of an infection and the likelihood of deaths, but was risky and couldn’t eliminate the virus.\nInstitutionalized variolation\nA British ambassador's wife, Lady Mary Wortley Montague (1689–1762) was the force that pushed for government-mandated variolation in England.\nShe had suffered a smallpox infection when she was younger and had lost her younger brother to the disease at the age of 26. She first learned about variolation when she arrived in 1717 in Istanbul, where variolation was commonly practiced. She later had the embassy inoculate her two children.\nNews about the practice spread among the royal family. After following trials, Charles Maitland, a physician, successfully inoculated the two daughters of the Princess of Wales with variolation in 1722. Thereafter, variolation became a common practice in Great Britain and became known in other European countries.\nIt became an even more established practice when the French King Louis XV died of smallpox in May of 1776 and his successor and grandson Louis XVI was inoculated with the variola virus one month later.\nVaccine against smallpox\nAt the end of the 18th century, British surgeon and physician Edward Jenner (1749-1823) pioneered the first-ever vaccination against an infectious disease.\nHe had been inoculated through variolation at the age of 8, and later as a surgeon, variolation was part of his work. 24\nHe also observed that people who had suffered from cowpox would subsequently have a very mild, if at all visible, reaction to the smallpox variolation. This was because the cowpox and variola viruses were members of the same virus family, called orthopox viruses, and provided immunity against each other, which he had unknowingly observed.\nHe hypothesized that variolation using the cowpox virus would protect children against smallpox as well. Since cowpox infections were much milder and never fatal, this would eliminate the problem of variolated children being carriers of smallpox and sometimes dying of the virus developing into a full-blown infection. In addition, it could reduce the pool of humans that the variola virus needed to survive, and it brought elimination, and eventually eradication, of smallpox into the realm of possibility.\nIn May 1796, Jenner inoculated a boy with cowpox, and then a few months later, with the smallpox virus. When the boy did not develop any smallpox symptoms in response to being variolated, his hypothesis that cowpox offered protection from smallpox was confirmed, motivating his further research trials.\nInitially, Jenner faced major barriers to spreading the word about his discovery. When he submitted a paper outlining his findings to the journal Philosophical Transactions edited by the Royal Society, it was rejected. They even advised him not to pursue his ideas any further, pointing to the detrimental impact on his career and reputation. Undeterred, he published his work with an increased number of trials at his own expense two years later, in 1798. He also went on to convince colleagues and supply them with vaccines in other British cities of his new procedure that became known as vaccination (derived from the Latin word for cow, Vacca ).\nBy 1802, the British Parliament did acknowledge his important contribution and awarded him £30,000. Meanwhile, vaccination had spread to most of Europe and New England. 25\nHis 1798 publication Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae known as the Cow Pox had been translated into German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Italian, and Latin within three years. US President Thomas Jefferson was an important figure in the widespread application of vaccination throughout the United States, and in 1806, he thanked Edward Jenner in a letter for his discovery and famously predicted \"Future generations will know by history only that the loathsome smallpox existed and by you has been extirpated.\" 26\nThe dramatic decline in smallpox fatalities in response to Jenner's vaccine can be traced in the chart, which shows the number of deaths due to smallpox as a share of all deaths in London from 1629 to 1902. Before the introduction of a smallpox vaccine in 1796, around 7% of all deaths annually were caused by smallpox. Following the introduction of the vaccine, a clear decline in smallpox deaths is visible.\nSmallpox Eradication Program\nIt was only with the establishment of the World Health Organization (WHO) that international quality standards for the production of smallpox vaccines were introduced. This shifted the fight against smallpox from a national to an international agenda. It was also the first time that global data collection on the prevalence of smallpox was undertaken.\nBy 1959, the World Health Assembly, the governing body of the World Health Organization (WHO), had passed a resolution to eradicate smallpox globally. But it was not until 1966, that funding was provided to the \"Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program\" to increase efforts for smallpox eradication.\nBy 1966, the number of infections of smallpox had already substantially been reduced by national governments' efforts. Nonetheless, skepticism about the feasibility of eradication prevailed, as some previous efforts to eradicate diseases — such as malaria and yaws — had failed. Furthermore, funding for the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Programme was insufficient to meet global needs, which resulted in vaccine shortages. 27\nIn addition, continued globalization and the growth of international air travel resulted in the continual re-introduction of the disease into countries that had previously managed to eliminate smallpox.\nOvercoming the last mile problem: ring vaccination\nSmallpox's eradication was greatly spurred by making use of the fact that smallpox transmission occurs via air droplets.\nInitially, the WHO had pursued a strategy of mass vaccination which attempted to vaccinate as many people as possible, hoping that herd immunity (explained in our vaccine topic page ) would protect the whole population. Soon, however, vaccination efforts were targeted locally around smallpox cases, because smallpox was transmitted by sick patients' air droplets. This practice is known as “ ring vaccination ”.\nPeople who had been in direct contact with a smallpox patient over the last two weeks were quarantined and vaccinated. The downside of such an approach was that the virus could spread easily if it was re-introduced from overseas. This was the case in Bangladesh, for example, which had previously eliminated smallpox until 1972 when it was brought back from across its border with India. 28\nDespite the risk of re-introductions, ring vaccination greatly reduced the cost of the eradication campaign. The number of administered vaccines declined and smallpox was increasingly brought under control. 2\nOne of the last strongholds of the variola virus was India. While 58% of global reported smallpox cases were reported in India in 1973, this increased to 86% in 1974. 29 Major pushes in vaccination campaigns, however, successfully drove down the number of infections to zero in India in 1976.\nCorrelates & consequences\nImpact on life expectancy\nDid smallpox variolation and vaccination against smallpox have a notable impact on life expectancy?\nMany have claimed that inoculation against smallpox was one of the first measures that had a positive effect on life expectancy . Angus Deaton (2013) makes this claim based on a book by Razzell (1977), which reviews existing birth, baptism and burial records in various counties of 18th century Britain. 30 31\nIt is hard to prove such claims because of the limited amount of high-quality data on both life expectancy and smallpox cases or deaths before the smallpox vaccine was developed in 1796 and adopted across countries.\nThe high case fatality rate of approximately 30% (of the variola major virus) meant that smallpox shortened the lives of many. Since the virus predominantly affected children , smallpox deaths are likely to have had a disproportionate impact on average life expectancy.\nThe chart below shows Sweden's life expectancy versus deaths from smallpox from 1774 to 1900.\nLarge smallpox outbreaks were documented in the years 1779, 1784, 1789, 1795 and 1800. These years coincide with sharp declines in life expectancy, implying that smallpox endemicity did have a substantial effect on life expectancy.\nFurthermore, the available data show dramatic declines in mortality in London as well as in Sweden (below) from 1800 onwards, after the vaccine was developed.\nJenner's vaccine appears to have had a notable impact on increased life expectancy but this, to our knowledge, has not been studied in significant detail. 32\nCosts of smallpox and its eradication\nBy the time the World Health Organization launched the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program in 1967 many countries, most of them high income countries, had already eliminated smallpox. Therefore, the total cost of eradicating smallpox is very challenging to estimate — as individual country programs reach back to before records of public health expenditure existed.\nNonetheless, the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program has been estimated to have cost $300 million in total from 1967 to 1977 33 with one-third of the funding provided by international donors and the remaining two-thirds financed by endemic country governments. 34\nBeyond direct program costs, smallpox incurred much higher indirect costs in the form of foregone economic performance.\nIt has been estimated that smallpox cost low-to-middle income countries more than $1 billion per year at the beginning of the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program in 1967, with more than $20 million dedicated to the care of infected patients. 35 Industrialized countries incurred much lower costs: $350 million in 1968, which included vaccination programs and absence from work costs. 36\nOverall, the Center for Global Development 37 estimated that direct and indirect costs of smallpox cost the world approximately $1.35 billion in the late 1960s.\nFollowing its eradication, countries now do not have to spend money on vaccine development and administration. Estimates on the savings from forgone costs thanks to the eradication of smallpox exist, but we are not aware of estimates that we would consider reliable. 38\nKey Charts on Smallpox\nDiscrepancy between reported and revised numbers of global smallpox cases\nNumber of reported smallpox cases\nNumber of reported smallpox cases by world region\nSmallpox cases reported worldwide\nSmallpox death rate Until 1900\nSmallpox death rate versus life expectancy in Sweden\nSmallpox deaths as a share of all deaths in London 1629 to 1902\nSmallpox: when was it eliminated in each country?\nEndnotes\nWhile one other disease, Rinderpest, has also been eradicated, smallpox is the only one that infected humans.

Social Security is a social insurance program officially called \"Old-age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance\" (OASDI), in reference to its three components. It is primarily funded through a dedicated payroll tax . During 2015, total benefits of $897 billion were paid out versus $920 billion in income, a $23 billion annual surplus. Excluding interest of $93 billion, the program had a cash deficit of $70 billion. Social Security represents approximately 40% of the income of the elderly, with 53% of married couples and 74% of unmarried persons receiving 50% or more of their income from the program. [ 1 ] An estimated 169 million people paid into the program and 60 million received benefits in 2015, roughly 2.82 workers per beneficiary. [ 2 ] Reform proposals continue to circulate with some urgency, due to a long-term funding challenge faced by the program as the ratio of workers to beneficiaries falls, driven by the aging of the baby-boom generation, expected continuing low birth rate , and increasing life expectancy . Program payouts began exceeding cash program revenues (i.e., revenue excluding interest) in 2011; this shortfall is expected to continue indefinitely under current law. [ 2 ]\nSocial Security has collected approximately $2.8 trillion more in payroll taxes and interest than have been paid out since tax collection began in 1937. This surplus is referred to as the Social Security Trust Fund . [ 3 ] The fund contains non-marketable Treasury securities backed \"by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government\". The funds borrowed from the program are part of the total national debt of $18.9 trillion as of December 2015. [ 4 ] Due to interest, the Trust Fund will continue increasing through the end of 2020, reaching a peak of approximately $2.9 trillion. Social Security has the legal authority to draw amounts from other government revenue sources besides the payroll tax, to fully fund the program, while the Trust Fund exists; however, payouts greater than payroll tax revenue and interest income over time will liquidate the Trust Fund by 2035, meaning that only the ongoing payroll tax collections thereafter will be available to fund the program. [ 2 ]\nThere are certain key implications to understand under current law, if no reforms are implemented:\nPayroll taxes will only cover about 79% of the scheduled payout amounts from 2034 and beyond. Without changes to the law, Social Security would have no legal authority to draw other government funds to cover the shortfall. [ 2 ]\nBetween 2021 and 2035, redemption of the Trust Fund balance to pay retirees will draw approximately $3 trillion in government funds from sources other than payroll taxes. This is a funding challenge for the government overall, not just Social Security; however, as the Trust Fund is reduced, so is that component of the National Debt , and the Trust Fund amount is in effect replaced by public debt outside the program. [ 2 ]\nThe present value of unfunded obligations under Social Security was approximately $11.4 trillion over a 75-year forecast period (2016–2090). In other words, that amount would have to be set aside in 2016 so that the principal and interest would cover the shortfall for 75 years. The estimated annual shortfall averages 2.49% of the payroll tax base or 0.9% of gross domestic product (a measure of the size of the economy). Measured over the infinite horizon, these figures are 4.0% and 1.4%, respectively. [ 2 ]\nThe annual cost of Social Security benefits represented 4.0% of GDP in 2000 and 5.0% GDP in 2015. This is projected to increase gradually to 6.4% of GDP in 2035 and then decline to about 6.1% of GDP by 2055 and remain at about that level through 2086. [ 5 ]\nPresident Barack Obama opposed privatization (i.e., diverting payroll taxes or equivalent savings to private accounts) or raising the retirement age, but supported raising the annual maximum amount of compensation that is subject to the Social Security payroll tax ($137,700 in 2020) to help fund the program. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] In addition, on February 18, 2010, President Obama issued an executive order mandating the creation of the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform , [ 8 ] which made ten specific recommendations to ensure the sustainability of Social Security. [ 9 ]\nFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on October 4, 2006: \"Reform of our unsustainable entitlement programs should be a priority ... the imperative to undertake reform earlier rather than later is great.\" [ 10 ] The tax increases or benefit cuts required to maintain the system as it exists under current law are significantly higher the longer such changes are delayed. For example, raising the payroll tax rate to 15% during 2016 (from the current 12.4%) or cutting benefits by 19%, or eliminating the annual maximum amount of compensation that is subject to the Social Security payroll tax, would address the program's budgetary concerns indefinitely; these amounts increase to 16% and 21% respectively if no changes are made until 2034. [ 2 ] During 2015, the Congressional Budget Office reported on the financial effects of various reform options. [ 11 ]\nBackground on funding challenges\nOverview\nSocial Security is funded through the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA), a payroll tax. [ 12 ] Employers and employees are each responsible for making tax payments of 6.2% of wages in 2018 (12.4% total) as FICA contributions, typically withdrawn from paychecks. Non-employee contractors are responsible for the entire 12.4%. During 2018, Social Security taxes were levied on the first $128,400 of income for employment; amounts earned above that are not taxed. [ 13 ] Covered workers are eligible for retirement and disability benefits. If a covered worker dies, his or her spouse and children may receive survivors' benefits. Social Security accounts are not the property of their beneficiary and are used solely to determine benefit levels. Social Security funds are not invested on behalf of beneficiaries. Instead, current tax receipts are used to pay current benefits (the system known as \" pay-as-you-go \"), as is typical of some insurance and defined-benefit plans.\nIn each year since 1983, tax receipts and interest income have exceeded benefit payments and other expenditures, in 2009 by more than $120 billion. However, without further legislation, or change in benefits, this annual surplus will change to a deficit around 2021, [ 14 ] when payments begin to exceed receipts and interest thereafter. The fiscal pressures are due to demographic trends, where the number of workers paying into the program continues declining relative to those receiving benefits.\nDemographics\nThe number of workers paying into the program was 5.1 per retiree in 1960; this declined to 3.3 in 2007 and is projected to decline to 2.1 by 2035. [ 15 ] Furthermore, life expectancy continues to increase, meaning retirees collect benefits longer. Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke has indicated that the aging of the population is a long-term trend, rather than a proverbial \"pig moving through the python \". [ 10 ]\nThe number of program recipients was 60.9 million in 2016, up approximately 0.9 million from 2015. The number receiving retirement benefits rose by 1.2 million, while the number receiving survivors and disability benefits fell by a total of approximately 0.3 million. [ 16 ]\nSocial Security Trust Fund\nSocial Security payroll taxes and interest received are added to the Fund, while expenses (payments to recipients) are deducted from the Fund. For example, during 2016, the initial balance as of January 1 was $2,780 billion. An additional $710 billion in payroll tax revenue and $87 billion in interest added to the Fund during 2016, while expenses of $776 billion were removed from the Fund, for a December 31, 2016 balance of $2,801 billion (i.e., $2,780 + $710 + $87 - $776 = $2,801). [ 17 ]\nThe accumulated surpluses are invested in special non-marketable Treasury securities (treasuries) issued by the U.S. government, which are deposited in the Social Security Trust Fund . At the end of 2009, the Trust Fund stood at $2.5 trillion. The $2.5 trillion amount owed by the federal government to the Social Security Trust Fund is also a component of the U.S. National Debt , which stood at $15.7 trillion as of May 2012. [ 18 ] By 2017, the government had borrowed nearly $2.8 trillion against the Social Security Trust Fund.\nProjections were made by the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds (OASDI) in their 71st annual report dated May 13, 2011. Expenses exceeded tax receipts in 2010. The Trust Fund is projected to continue to grow for several years thereafter because of interest income from loans made to the US Treasury .\nHowever, the funds from loans made have been spent along with other revenues in the general funds in satisfying annual budgets. At some point, however, absent any change in the law, the Social Security Administration will finance payment of benefits through the net redemption of the assets in the Trust Fund. Because those assets consist solely of U.S. government securities, their redemption will represent a call on the federal government's general fund, which for decades has been borrowing the Trust Fund's surplus and applying it to its expenses to partially satisfy budget deficits. To finance such a projected call on the general fund, some combination of increasing taxes, cutting other government spending or programs, selling government assets, or borrowing would be required.\nThe balances in the Trust Fund are projected to be depleted either by 2036 [ 19 ] (OASDI Trustees' 2011 projection), or by 2038 [ 20 ] (Congressional Budget Office's extended-baseline scenario) assuming proper and continuous repayment of the outstanding treasury notes. At that point, under current law, the system's benefits would have to be paid from the FICA tax alone. Revenues from FICA are projected at that point to be continue to cover about 77% of projected Social Security benefits if no change is made to the current tax and benefit schedules.\nPayroll tax rates were cut during 2011 and 2012 as a stimulus measure; these cuts expired at the end of 2012. The Social Security Trustees estimated the amounts at $222 billion total; $108 billion in 2011 and $114 billion in 2012. Transfers of other government funds made the program \"whole\" as if these tax cuts had not occurred. [ 21 ]\nIn an annually issued report released in August 2021, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that the Old-Age and Survivors Trust Fund was projected to be able to pay scheduled benefits until 2033 while the Disability Insurance Trust Fund was projected to be able to pay its benefits through 2057 (and through 2034 when the funds were hypothetically combined), 1 year and 8 years earlier respectively than the previous report found. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] In June 2022, the Treasury Department issued an updated report for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds with revised projections for their ability to pay scheduled benefits to 2034 and 2057 respectively and by 2035 when hypothetically combined due to accelerated recovery from the COVID-19 recession . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] In March 2023, the Treasury Department issued the annual trustees report for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds with depletion date projections for the funds estimated at 2033 and 2097 respectively and by 2034 when combined. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ]\nIn May 2024, the annual trustees report was released with depletion date projections for the funds estimated at 2033 and 2098 respectively and by 2035 when combined. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] The 1990 board of trustees annual report estimated the depletion date of the combined funds would be in 2043, [ 34 ] the 2000 and 2010 annual reports estimated the depletion date of the combined funds would be in 2037, [ 35 ] [ 36 ] and the 2020 annual report estimated the depletion date of the combined funds would be in 2035. [ 37 ] In a survey of 210 members of the American Economics Association published in November 2006, 85 percent agreed with the statement: \"The gap between Social Security funds and expenditures will become unsustainably large within the next fifty years if current policies remain unchanged.\" [ 38 ]\nEffect of unemployment on program funding\nIncreasing unemployment due to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008–2010 has significantly reduced the amount of payroll tax income that funds Social Security. [ 39 ] Further, the crisis also caused more to apply for both retirement and disability benefits than expected. [ 40 ] During 2009, payroll taxes and taxation of benefits resulted in cash revenues of $689.2 billion, while payments totaled $685.8 billion, resulting in a cash surplus (excluding interest) of $3.4 billion. Interest of $118.3 billion meant that the Social Security Trust Fund overall increased by $121.7 billion (i.e., the cash surplus plus interest). [ 41 ] The 2009 cash surplus of $3.4 billion was a significant reduction from the $63.9 billion cash surplus of 2008. [ 42 ]\nEffect of income inequality on program funding\nRising income inequality also affects the funding of the Social Security program. The Center for Economic and Policy Research estimated in February 2013 that upward redistribution of income is responsible for about 43% of the projected Social Security shortfall over the next 75 years. [ 43 ] This is because income over the payroll tax cap ($127,200 in 2017) is not taxed; if individuals generate higher income above the taxable income limit, that lack of additional taxation results in lower funding than possible if there were no income limit.\nThe Social Security Administration explained in 2011 that historically, an average of roughly 83% of covered earnings have been subject to the payroll tax. In 1983, this figure reached 90%, but it has declined since then. As of 2010, about 86% of covered earnings fall under the taxable maximum. [ 44 ]\nSize of funding challenge\nThe CBO projected in 2010 that an increase in payroll taxes ranging from 1.6–2.1% of the payroll tax base, equivalent to 0.6–0.8% of GDP, would be necessary to put the Social Security program in fiscal balance for the next 75 years. [ 45 ] In other words, raising the payroll tax rate to about 14.4% during 2009 (from the current 12.4%) or cutting benefits by 13.3% would address the program's budgetary concerns indefinitely; these amounts increase to around 16% and 24% if no changes are made until 2037. The value of unfunded obligations under Social Security during FY 2009 was approximately $5.4 trillion. In other words, this amount would have to be set aside today such that the principal and interest would cover the shortfall over the next 75 years. [ 46 ] Projections of Social Security's solvency are sensitive to assumptions about rates of economic growth and demographic changes. [ 47 ]\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote in 2010: \"The 75-year Social Security shortfall is about the same size as the cost, over that period, of extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for the richest 2 percent of Americans (those with incomes above $250,000 a year). Members of Congress cannot simultaneously claim that the tax cuts for people at the top are affordable while the Social Security shortfall constitutes a dire fiscal threat.\" [ 48 ]\nEffect on the budget deficit\nBecause Social Security tax receipts and interest exceed payments, the program also reduces the size of the annual federal budget deficit commonly reported in the media. For example, CBO reported that for fiscal year 2012, the \"On-budget Deficit\" was $1,151.3 billion. Social Security and the Post Office are considered \"Off-Budget\". Social Security had an estimated surplus of $62.4 billion by CBO accounting (different from the $54 billion reported by the Trustees) and the Post Office had a deficit of $0.5, resulting in a \"Total Budget Deficit\" of $1,089.4 billion. This latter figure is the one commonly reported in the media. [ 49 ]\nFraming the debate\nIdeological arguments\nIdeology plays a major part of framing the Social Security debate. Key points of philosophical debate include, among others: [ 50 ]\ndegree of ownership and choice among investment alternatives in determining one's own financial future;\nthe right and extent of government taxation and wealth redistribution;\ntrade-offs between social insurance and wealth creation;\nwhether the program represents (or is perceived as) a charitable safety net (entitlement) or earned benefits; and\nintergenerational equity , meaning the rights of those living today to impose burdens on future generations. [ 10 ]\nRetirees and others who receive Social Security benefits have become an important bloc of voters in the United States. Indeed, Social Security has been called \"the third rail of American politics\" [ 51 ] —meaning that any politician sparking fears about cuts in benefits by touching the program endangers his or her political career. The New York Times wrote in January 2009 that Social Security and Medicare \"have proved almost sacrosanct in political terms, even as they threaten to grow so large as to be unsustainable in the long run\". [ 52 ]\nConservative ideological arguments\nConservatives and libertarians argue that Social Security reduces individual ownership by redistributing wealth from workers to retirees and bypassing the free market. Social Security taxes paid into the system cannot be passed to future generations, as private accounts can, thereby preventing the accumulation of wealth to some degree. [ 53 ] According to the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank, private accounts have a much higher rate of return than Social Security accounts. [ 54 ] Conservatives tend to argue for a fundamental change in the structure of the program.  Conservatives also argue that the U.S. Constitution does not permit the Congress to set up a savings plan for retirees (leaving this authority to the states), although the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Helvering v. Davis that Congress had this authority.\nLiberal ideological arguments\nLiberals argue that government has the obligation to provide social insurance, through mandatory participation and broad program coverage. During 2004, Social Security constituted more than half of the income of nearly two-thirds of retired Americans. For one in six, it is their only income. [ 55 ] Liberals tend to defend the current program, preferring tax increases and payment modifications. [ 56 ] [ 57 ]\nEconomist Lawrence Summers wrote in August 2016 that raising the Social Security payouts could reduce the savings rate, as the economy faced a post-crisis savings surplus, which was driving down interest rates: \"...[A]t current interest rates an increase in pay as you go social security could provide households with higher safe returns than private investments.  More generous Social Security would likely reduce the saving rate, thereby raising the neutral interest rate [the rate required to achieve full employment] with no change in budget deficits.\" [ 58 ]\nPro-privatization arguments\nThe conservative position is often pro-privatization. There are countries other than the U.S. that have set up individual accounts for individual workers, which allow workers leeway in decisions about the securities in which their accounts are invested, which pay workers after retirement through annuities funded by the individual accounts, and which allow the funds to be inherited by the workers' heirs. Such systems are referred to as 'privatized.' [ citation needed ] Currently, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Chile are the most frequently cited examples of privatized systems. [ citation needed ] The experiences of these countries are being debated as part of the current Social Security controversy. [ citation needed ]\nIn the United States in the late 1990s, privatization found advocates who complained that U.S. workers, paying compulsory payroll taxes into Social Security, were missing out on the high rates of return of the U.S. stock market (the Dow averaged 5.3% compounded annually for the 20th century [ 59 ] ). They likened their proposed \"Private Retirement Accounts\" (PRAs) to the popular Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) savings plans. But in the meantime, several conservative and libertarian organizations that considered it a crucial issue, such as The Heritage Foundation and Cato Institute , continued to lobby for some form of Social Security privatization.\nAnti-privatization arguments\nThe liberal position is typically anti-privatization. Those who have taken an anti-privatization position argue several points (among others), including: [ 55 ]\nPrivatization may not address Social Security's long-term funding challenges. The program is \"pay as you go\", meaning current payroll taxes pay for current retirees. Diverting payroll taxes (or other sources of government funds) to fund private accounts would drive enormous deficits and borrowing (\"transition costs\").\nPrivatization converts the program from a \"defined benefits\" plan to a \"defined contribution\" plan, subjecting the ultimate payouts to stock or bond market fluctuations;\nSocial Security payouts are indexed to wages, which historically have exceeded inflation. As such, Social Security payments are protected from inflation, while private accounts might not be;\nPrivatization would represent a windfall for Wall Street financial institutions, who would obtain significant fees for managing private accounts.\nPrivatization in the midst of the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression would have caused households to have lost even more of their assets, had their investments been invested in the U.S. stock market.\nChronology of prior reform attempts and proposals\nA roots of partial reform attempts or proposal of social security may be able to go trace back the 1930s when institutions are established. [ 60 ]\nOctober 1997 – The Democratic president, Bill Clinton , and the Republican Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich , reached a secret agreement to reform Social Security.  The agreement required both the President and the Speaker to forge a centrist coalition by persuading moderate members of Congress from their respective parties to compromise. [ 61 ]\nJanuary 1998 – Progress on the reform agreement reached on October 28, 1997, between Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich was derailed by the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal approximately a week before Clinton was to announce the initiative in his State of the Union address. [ 62 ]\nMarch 1999 - Republican Senators Spencer Abraham and Pete Domenici circulate the first of a series of \"lock box\" proposals. These proposals would amend each house's rules, declaring it out of order to consider any bill that would contribute to a Social Security deficit unless a majority or supermajority votes to suspend the rules. All of these proposals failed, but Vice President Al Gore would make the \"lock box\" concept a part of his presidential campaign program in 2000.\nFebruary 2005 – Republican President George W. Bush outlined a major initiative to reform Social Security which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax ( FICA ) into secured investments. In his 2005 State of the Union Address , Bush discussed the potential bankruptcy of the program. Democrats opposed the proposal. [ 63 ] Bush campaigned for the initiative in a 60-day national tour. [ 64 ] However, public support for the proposal only declined. [ 65 ] The House Republican leadership tabled Social Security reform for the remainder of the session. [ 66 ] In the 2006 midterm elections ,  Democrats gained control of both houses, effectively killing the plan for the remainder of Bush's term in office.\nDecember 2011 – Democratic President Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform proposed the \"Bowles-Simpson\" plan for making the system solvent. It combined increases in the Social Security payroll tax and reductions in benefits, starting several years in the future. It would have reduced benefits for upper-income workers while raising them for those with lifetime earnings averaging less than $11,000 a year. Republicans rejected the tax increases and Democrats rejected benefit cuts. A powerful network of elderly and liberal organizations and union workers also fought any changes. [ 67 ]\nAlternate views\nAdvocates of major change in the system generally argue that drastic action is necessary because Social Security is facing a crisis. In his 2005 State of the Union speech, President George W. Bush indicated that Social Security was facing \"bankruptcy\". [ 68 ] In his 2006 State of the Union speech, he described entitlement reform (including Social Security) as a \"national challenge\" that, if not addressed timely, would \"present future Congresses with impossible choices – staggering tax increases, immense deficits, or deep cuts in every category of spending\". [ 69 ]\nA liberal think tank , The Center for Economic and Policy Research, says that \"Social Security is more financially sound today than it has been throughout most of its 69-year history\"  and that Bush's statement should have no credibility. [ 70 ]\nIn 2004 Nobel Laureate economist Paul Krugman , deriding what he called \"the hype about a Social Security crisis\", wrote: [ 71 ]\n[T]here is a long-run financing problem. But it's a problem of modest size. The [CBO] report finds that extending the life of the Trust Fund into the 22nd century, with no change in benefits, would require additional revenues equal to only 0.54 percent of G.D.P. That's less than 3 percent of federal spending—less than we're currently spending in Iraq . And it's only about one-quarter of the revenue lost each year because of President Bush's tax cuts—roughly equal to the fraction of those cuts that goes to people with incomes over $500,000 a year. Given these numbers, it's not at all hard to come up with fiscal packages that would secure the retirement program, with no major changes, for generations to come.\nPresident Ronald Reagan stated in October 1984: \"Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit...Social Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee. If you reduce the outgo of Social Security that money would not go into the general fund to reduce the deficit. It would go into the Social Security trust fund.  So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.\" [ 73 ]\nThe claims of the probability of future difficulty with the current Social Security system are largely based on the annual analysis made of the system and its prospects and reported by the governors of the Social Security system. While such analysis can never be 100% accurate, it can at least be made using different probable future scenarios and be based on rational assumptions and reach rational conclusions, with the conclusions being no better (in terms of predicting the future) than the assumptions on which the predictions are based. With these predictions in hand, it is possible to make at least some prediction of what the future retirement security of Americans who will rely on Social Security might be. It is worth noting that James Roosevelt, former associate commissioner for Retirement Policy for the Social Security Administration, claims that the \"crisis\" is more a myth than a fact. [ 74 ]\nThe Social Security public trustees including Charles Blahous warned in May 2013 that the \"window for effective action\" to take place was \"rapidly closing\", with less favorable options available to rectify the problems as time passes. [ 75 ]\nProponents of the current system argue if and when the Trust Fund runs out, there will still be the choice of raising taxes or cutting benefits, or both. [ 76 ] Advocates of the current system say that the projected deficits in Social Security are identical to the \"prescription drug benefit\" enacted in 2002. They say that demographic and revenue projections might turn out to be too pessimistic—and that the current health of the economy exceeds the assumptions used by the Social Security Administration.\nThese Social Security proponents argue that the correct plan is to fix Medicare , which is the largest underfunded entitlement, repeal the 2001–2004 tax cuts, and balance the budget. They believe a growth trendline will emerge from these steps, and the government can alter the Social Security mix of taxes, benefits, benefit adjustments and retirement age to avoid future deficits. The age at which one begins to receive Social Security benefits has been raised several times since the program's inception. [ citation needed ]\nStudies of Social Security policy alternatives\nRobert L. Clark , an economist at North Carolina State University who specializes in aging issues , formerly served as a chairman of a national panel on Social Security's financial status; he has said that future options for Social Security are clear: \"You either raise taxes or you cut benefits. There are lots of ways to do both.\" [ 77 ]\nDavid Koitz, a 30-year veteran of the Congressional Research Service , echoed these remarks in his 2001 book Seeking Middle Ground on Social Security Reform: \"The real choices for resolving the system's problems...require current lawmakers to raise revenue or cut spending—to change the law now to explicitly raise future taxes or constrain future benefits.\" He discusses the 1983 Social Security amendments that followed the Greenspan Commission's recommendations. It was the commission's recommendations that provided political cover for both political parties to act. The changes approved by President Reagan in 1983 were phased in over time and included raising the retirement age from 65 to 67, taxation of benefits, cost of living adjustment (COLA) delays, and inclusion of new federal hires in the program. There was a key point during the debate when House members were forced to choose between raising the retirement age or raising future taxes; they chose the former.  Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan indicated the compromises involved showed that lawmakers could still govern. Koitz cautions against the concept of a free lunch ; retirement security cannot be provided without benefit cuts or tax increases. [ 50 ]\nEconomist Alice M. Rivlin summarized major reform proposals in January 2009: \"Fixing Social Security is a relatively easy technical problem. It will take some combination of several much-discussed marginal changes: raising the retirement age gradually in the future (and then indexing it to longevity), raising the cap on the payroll tax, fixing the cost of living adjustment, and modifying the indexing of initial benefits so they grow more slowly for more affluent people. In view of the collapse of market values, no one is likely to argue seriously for diverting existing revenues to private accounts, so the opportunity to craft a compromise is much greater than it was a few years ago. Fixing Social Security would be a confidence building achievement for bi-partisan cooperation and would enhance our reputation for fiscal prudence.\" [ 78 ]\nVarious institutions have analyzed different reform alternatives, including the CBO, U.S. News & World Report , [ 79 ] the AARP, [ 80 ] [ 81 ] and the Urban Institute . [ 82 ]\nCBO studies\nThe CBO reported in July 2010 the effects of a series of policy options on the \"actuarial balance\" shortfall, which over the 75 year horizon is approximately 0.6% of GDP. Social Security is facing a long-run shortfall of approximately 1% GDP per year or $155 billion/year in 2012 dollars. Key reform proposals include: [ 83 ]\nRemoving the cap on the payroll tax. Income over a threshold ($110,100 in 2012) is not subject to the payroll tax, nor are additional benefits paid to those with income above this level. Removing the cap would fund the entire 75-year shortfall.\nRaising the retirement age gradually. Raising the full-benefit retirement age to 70 would fund half the 75-year shortfall.\nReducing cost of living adjustments (COLA), which are annual payout increases to keep pace with wages. Reducing each year's COLA by 0.5% versus the current formula would fund half the shortfall over 75 years.\nReducing Initial Benefits for wealthier retirees, based on lifetime earnings.\nRaising the payroll tax rate. Raising the rate by one percentage point would cover half the shortfall for 75 years. Raising the rate by two percentage points gradually over 20 years would cover the entire shortfall.\nOne way to measure mandatory program risks is in terms of unfunded liabilities, the amount that would have to be set aside today such that principal and interest would cover program shortfalls (spending over tax revenue dedicated to the program). These are measured over a 75-year period and infinite horizon by the program's Trustees:\nThe present value of unfunded obligations under Social Security was approximately $8.6 trillion over a 75-year forecast period (2012-2086). The estimated annual shortfall averages 2.5% of the payroll tax base or 0.9% of gross domestic product (a measure of the size of the economy). Measured over the infinite horizon, these figures are $20.5 trillion, 3.9% and 1.3%, respectively. [ 2 ]\nThe CBO estimated in January 2012 that raising the full retirement age for Social Security from 67 to 70 would reduce outlays by about 13%. Raising the early retirement age from 62 to 64 has little impact, as those who wait longer to begin receiving benefits get a higher amount. Raising the retirement age increases the size of the workforce and the size of the economy by about 1%. [ 84 ]\nThe CBO provided estimates regarding various reform alternatives in a July 2014 letter to Senator Orrin Hatch .  For example, CBO wrote: \"To bring the OASDI [Social Security] program as a whole into actuarial balance through 2087 with the taxable maximum set according to current law [$118,500 in 2015], the combined OASDI payroll tax rate could be permanently increased by about 3.5 percentage points...Under that option, the combined OASDI payroll tax rate would rise from 12.4 percent to 15.9 percent in 2015. Revenues credited to the Social Security trust funds in 2015 would increase by about 28 percent.\" This would raise taxes for a worker earning $50,000 by about $900 per year. [ 85 ]\nAARP study\nThe AARP publishes its views on Social Security reform options periodically. It summarized its views on a series of reform options during October 2012. [ 86 ]\nUrban Institute study\nThe Urban Institute estimated the effects of alternative solutions during May 2010, along with an estimated program deficit reduction: [ 82 ]\nReducing the cost of living adjustments (COLA) by one percentage point: 75%\nIncreasing the full retirement age to 68: 30%\nIndexing the COLA to prices rather than wages, except for bottom one-third of income earners: 65%\nRaising the payroll tax cap (capped at $106,800 in 2010) to cover 90% instead of 84% of earnings: 35%\nRaising the payroll tax rate by one percentage point: 50%.\nFiscal Reform Commission\nOn February 18, 2010, President Obama issued an executive order mandating the creation of the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, [ 8 ] which had the goal to \"[e]nsure lasting Social Security solvency, prevent the projected 22% cuts to come in 2037, reduce elderly poverty, and distribute the burden fairly\". [ 87 ] The co-chairmen of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform published their final report in December 2010. [ 88 ] The co-chairmen estimated the effects of alternative solutions, along with an estimated program deficit reduction:\nRaising the payroll tax cap to cover 90% of earnings: 35%\nIndexing retirement age to life expectancy: 21%\nAdjusting the COLA formula to reflect chained CPI (e.g., reduce the COLA): 26% [ 89 ]\nIn addition, the final report proposed the steps to ensure the sustainability of Social Security, such as: [ 9 ]\n\"[M]andat[ing] coverage for all state and local workers newly hired after 2020\" to \"simplify retirement planning and benefit coordination for workers who spend part of their career working in state and local governments, and will ensure that all workers, regardless of employer, will retire with a secure and predictable benefit check\"; [ 90 ]\nEducating future retirees about \"the full implications of various retirement decisions, with an eye toward encouraging delayed retirement and enhanced levels of retirement savings\"; [ 91 ] and\nEnhancing dialogue regarding the importance of personal retirement savings and responsibility, including a focus reducing personal debt and increasing personal assets. [ 92 ]\nPresident Obama's proposals\nAs of September 14, 2008, Barack Obama indicated preliminary views on Social Security reform. His website indicated that he \"will work with members of Congress from both parties to strengthen Social Security and prevent privatization while protecting middle-class families from tax increases or benefit cuts. As part of a bipartisan plan that would be phased in over many years, he would ask families making over $250,000 to contribute a bit more to Social Security to keep it sound.\" He has opposed raising the retirement age, privatization, or cutting benefits. [ 93 ] [ 94 ]\nSpecific proposals by topic\nReduce cost of living adjustments\nThe current system sets the initial benefit level based on the retiree's past wages. The benefit level is based on the 35 highest years of earnings. This initial amount is then subject to an annual Cost of Living Adjustment or COLA . Recent COLA were 2.3% in 2007, 5.8% in 2008, and zero for 2009–2011. [ 95 ] [ 96 ]\nThe COLA is computed based on the \" Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers\" or CPI-W. According to the CBO: \"Many analysts believe that the CPI-W overstates increases in the cost of living because it does not fully account for the fact that consumers generally adjust their spending patterns as some prices change relative to others\". However, CBO also reported that: \"CPI-E, an experimental version of the CPI that reflects the purchasing patterns of older people, has been 0.3 percentage points higher than the CPI-W over the past three decades\". CBO estimates that reducing the COLA by 0.5% annually from its current computed amount would reduce the 75-year actuarial shortfall by 0.3% of GDP or about 50%. Reducing each year's COLA results in an annual compounding effect, with greater effect on those receiving benefits the longest. [ 97 ]\nThere is disagreement about whether a reduction in the COLA constitutes a \"benefit cut\"; the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities considers any reduction in future promised benefits to be a \"cut\". However, others dispute this assertion because under any indexing strategy the actual or nominal amount of Social Security checks would never decrease but could increase at a lesser rate.\nRaise the eligibility or retirement age\nCBO estimated in 2010 that raising the retirement age to 70 gradually would eliminate half the 75-year funding shortfall. [ 83 ] However, raising the retirement age disproportionally impacts lower-income workers and those who perform manual labor. The Social Security full payout retirement age in 2015 was 66 years of age; it is gradually rising to 67.  However, most Americans begin taking reduced early benefits at age 62.  While Americans are living longer, much of the increase in life expectancy is among those with higher incomes. The Social Security Administration estimated that retirees who made above-average incomes in their working years live six years longer than they did in the 1970s. However, retirees in the bottom half of the income distribution live only 1.3 years longer. In addition, many lower-income workers have jobs that require standing or manual labor, which becomes increasingly difficult for older workers. [ 98 ]\nProgressive indexing\nProgressive indexing would lower the COLA or benefit levels for higher wage groups, with no impact or lesser impact on lower-wage groups. The Congressional Research Service reported that: [ 99 ]\nProgressive indexing[...] would index initial benefits for low earners to wage growth (as under current law), index initial benefits for high earners to price growth (resulting in lower projected benefits compared to current-law promised benefits), and index benefits for middle earners to a combination of wage growth and price growth.\nPresident Bush endorsed a version of this approach suggested by financier Robert Pozen , which would mix price and wage indexing in setting the initial benefit level. The \" progressive \" feature is that the less generous price indexing would be used in greater proportion for retirees with higher incomes. The San Francisco Chronicle gave this explanation:\nUnder Pozen's plan, which is likely to be significantly altered even if the concept remains in legislation, all workers who earn more than about $25,000 a year would receive some benefit cuts. For example, those who retire in 50 years while earning about $36,500 a year would see their benefits reduced by 20 percent from the benefits promised under the current plan. Those who earn $90,000—the maximum income in 2005 for payroll taxes—and retire in 2055 would see their benefits cut 37 percent. [ 100 ]\nAs under the current system, all retirees would have their initial benefit amount adjusted periodically for price inflation occurring after their retirement. Thus, the purchasing power of the monthly benefit level would be frozen, rather than increasing by the difference between the (typically higher) CPI-W and (typically lower) CPI-U, a broader measure of inflation.\nAdjustments to the payroll tax limit\nDuring 2015, payroll taxes were levied on the first $118,500 of income; earnings above that amount were not taxed. Approximately 6% of workers earned over this amount in 2011. [ 101 ] [ 102 ] Because of this limit, people with higher incomes pay a lower percentage of tax than people with lower incomes; the payroll tax is therefore a regressive tax .\nCBO estimated in 2010 that removing the cap on the payroll tax (i.e., making all income subject to the flat payroll tax rate) would fully fund the program for 75 years. [ 83 ] Removing the cap on income over $250,000 only (i.e., a \"donut\" in the tax code) would address about 75% of the program shortfall over 75 years. [ 101 ]\n2013 Harkin bill\nIn March 2013, Senator Tom Harkin introduced S. 567: Strengthening Social Security Act of 2013. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] Supporters of the bill state that \"By making millionaires and billionaires pay the same rate of Social Security taxes as the rest of us, and by changing the method by which Social Security benefits are calculated, Sen. Harkin's bill would expand Social Security benefits by an average of $800 per recipient per year while also keeping the program solvent\" for \"generations\". [ 105 ] Supporters include the Alliance for Retired Americans [ 106 ] The letter of support by the Alliance, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization of 4 million, [ 107 ] states that S. 567 \"recognizes the true importance of this great American program and proposes measures that would both enhance benefits for current beneficiaries and strengthen the long-term solvency of Social Security for all Americans\". [ 108 ]\nDiamond-Orszag Plan\nPeter A. Diamond and Peter R. Orszag proposed in their 2005 book Saving Social Security: A Balanced Approach that Social Security be stabilized by various tax and spend adjustments and gradually ending the process by which the general fund has been borrowing from payroll taxes. This requires increased revenues devoted to Social Security. Their plan, as with several other Social Security stabilization plans, relies on gradually increasing the retirement age, raising the ceiling on which people must pay FICA taxes , and slowly increasing the FICA tax rate to a peak of 15% total from the current 12.4%. [ 109 ]\nExpanding Social Security benefits\nJohn B. Larson sponsored the Social Security 2100 Act, which would temporarily increase benefits. It would also eliminate reductions from the Social Security Government Pension Offset and Windfall Elimination Provision . It would also subject income over $400,000 to Federal Insurance Contributions Act . [ 110 ]\nPublic opinion polls\nAccording to a June 2014 Pew Research Center poll:\n67% supported no benefit reductions, with 27% supporting more benefits and 37% supporting a similar level of benefits.\n31% supported benefit reductions, with 24% supporting fewer benefits while 6% wanted to phase out the program.\nHowever, the poll also indicated Americans are skeptical about the future of the program: \"Among the overall public, just 14% expect that Social Security will have sufficient resources to provide the current level of benefits; 39% say there will be enough money to provide reduced benefits and 43% think that, when they retire, the program will be unable to provide any benefits.\" [ 111 ] [ 112 ]\nAccording to a December 2012 Pew Research Center poll:\n69% supported raising the tax rate on income over $250,000.\n51% supported reducing Social Security payments to high-income seniors.\n42% supported gradually raising the retirement age. [ 113 ]\nA January 2015 Pew Research Center poll indicated that \"Making Social Security system sound\" was the fifth highest priority of 23 topics. [ 114 ]\nAccording to a July 2015 Gallup poll, many Americans doubted they would get Social Security benefits, although the level of doubt was similar to readings going back to 1989. Over 50% of Americans said \"they doubt the system will be able to pay them a benefit when they retire.\" The percentage has fluctuated since its initial reading at 47% in 1989 and peaked as high as 60% in 2010.  The percentage was 30% for those aged 50–64, but above 60% for those 18–49. [ 115 ] This view runs contrary to the Social Security Trustees Reports, which indicate that since payroll taxes are dedicated to the program by law, even without reform Social Security will pay about 75% of promised benefits after the Trust Fund is exhausted in the early 2030s. [ 116 ]\nConceptual arguments regarding personal accounts\nCost of transition and long-term funding concerns\nCritics argue that privatizing Social Security does nothing to address the long-term funding concerns. Diverting funds to private accounts would reduce available funds to pay current retirees, requiring significant borrowing. An analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that President Bush's 2005 privatization proposal would add $1 trillion in new federal debt in its first decade of implementation and $3.5 trillion in the decade thereafter. The 2004 Economic Report of the President found that the federal budget deficit would be more than 1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) higher every year for roughly two decades; U.S. GDP in 2008 was $14 trillion. The debt burden for every man, woman, and child would be $32,000 higher after 32 years because of privatization. [ 117 ] [ 118 ]\nPrivatization proponents counter that the savings to the government would come through a mechanism called a \"clawback\", where profits from private account investment would be taxed, or a benefit reduction meaning that individuals whose accounts underperformed the market would receive less than current benefit schedules, although, even in this instance, the heirs of those who die early could receive increased benefits even if the accounts underperformed historical returns. [ citation needed ]\nOpponents of privatization also point out that, even conceding for sake of argument that what they call highly optimistic numbers are true, they fail to count what the transition will cost the country as a whole. Gary Thayer, chief economist for A. G. Edwards , has been cited in the mainstream media saying that the cost of privatizing—estimated by some at $1 trillion to $2 trillion—would worsen the federal budget deficit in the short term, and \"That's not something I think the credit markets would appreciate\". [ 119 ] If, as in some plans, the interest expenditure on this debt is recaptured from the private accounts before any gains are available to the workers, then the net benefit could be small or nonexistent. And this is really a key to understanding the debate, because if, on the other hand, a system which mandated investment of all assets in U.S. Treasuries resulted in a positive net recapturing, this would illustrate that the captive nature of the system results in benefits that are lower than if it merely allowed investment in U.S. Treasuries (purported to be the safest investment on Earth). [ citation needed ]\nCurrent Social Security system advocates claim that when the risks, overhead costs and borrowing costs of any privatization plan are taken together, the result is that such a plan has a lower expected rate of return than \"pay as you go\" systems. They point out the high overheads of privatized plans in the United Kingdom and Chile. [ citation needed ]\nRate of return and individual initiative\nEven some of those who oppose privatization agree that if current future promises to the current young generation are kept in the future, they will experience a much lower rate of return than past retirees have. [ 120 ] Under privatization, each worker's benefit would be the combination of a minimum guaranteed benefit and the return on the private account. The proponents' argument is that projected returns (higher than those individuals currently receive from Social Security) and ownership of the private accounts would allow lower spending on the guaranteed benefit, but possibly without any net loss of income to beneficiaries. [ 121 ]\nBoth wholesale and partial privatization pose questions such as: 1) How much added risk will workers bear compared to the risks they face under current system? 2) What are the potential rewards? and 3) What happens at retirement to workers whose privatized risks turn out badly?  For workers, privatization would mean smaller Social Security checks, in addition to increased compensation from returns on investments, according to historical precedent. [ 120 ] Debate has ensued over the advisability of subjecting workers' retirement money to market risks. [ 121 ]\nA technical economic argument for privatization is that, without it, the payroll taxes that support Social Security constitute a tax wedge that reduces the supply of labor, like other tax financed government welfare programs.  Liberal economists like Peter Orszag and Joseph Stiglitz have argued that Social Security is already perceived as enough of a forced savings program to preclude a reduction in the labor supply. [ 122 ] Richard Disney has agreed with this reply, noting, \"To the extent that pension contributions are perceived as giving individuals rights to future pensions, the behavioral reaction of program participants to contributions will differ from their reactions to other taxes. In fact, they might regard pension contributions as providing an opportunity for retirement saving, in which case contributions should not be deducted [by economists] from household's earnings and should not be included in the tax wedge .\" [ 123 ]\nPrivatization advocates nonetheless do not believe that social security taxes will be sufficiently regarded as pension contributions as long as they remain legally structured as taxes (as opposed to being contributions to their own private pensions).\nTo the extent that pension contributions are perceived as giving individuals rights to future pensions, the behavioral reaction of program participants to contributions will differ from their reactions to other taxes. In fact, they might regard pension contributions as providing an opportunity for retirement saving, in which case contributions should not be deducted from household's earnings and should not be included in the tax wedge.\nSupporters of the current system maintain that its combination of low risks and low management costs, along with its social insurance provisions, work well for what the system was designed to provide: a baseline income for citizens derived from savings . From their perspective, the major deficiency of any privatization scheme is risk. Like any private investments, PRAs could fail to produce any return or could produce a lower return than proponents of privatization assert, [ 121 ] and could even suffer a reduction in principal.\nAdvocates of privatization have long criticized Social Security for lower returns than the returns available from other investments, and cite numbers based on historical performance. The Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank, calculates that a 40-year-old male with an income just under $60,000, will contribute $284,360 in payroll taxes to the Social Security Trust Fund over his working life, and can expect to receive $2,208 per month in return under the current program. They claim that the same 40-year-old male, investing the same $284,360 equally weighted into treasuries and high-grade corporate bonds over his working life, would own a PRA at retirement worth $904,982 which would pay an annuity of up to $7,372 per month (assuming that the dollar volume of such investments would not dilute yields so that they are lower than averages from a period in which no such dilution occurred.) [ clarification needed ] Furthermore, they argue that the \"efficiency\" of the system should be measured not by costs as a percent of assets, but by returns after expenses (e.g. a 6% return reduced by 2% expenses would be preferable to a 3% return reduced by 1% expenses). [ 124 ] [ 125 ] Other advocates state that because privatization would increase the wealth of Social Security users, it would contribute to consumer spending , which in turn would cause economic growth.\nSupporters of the current system argue that the long-term trend of U.S. securities markets cannot safely be extrapolated forward, because stock prices relative to earnings are already at very high levels by historical standards. [ citation needed ] They add that an exclusive focus on long-term trends would ignore the increased risks they think privatization would cause. The general upward trend has been punctuated by severe downturns. Critics of privatization point out that workers attempting to retire during any future such downturns, even if they prove to be temporary, will be placed at a severe disadvantage.\nProponents argue that a privatized system would open up new funds for investment in the economy, and would produce real growth. They claim that the treasuries held in the current Trust Fund are covering consumption rather than investments, and that their value rests solely upon the continued ability of the U.S. government to impose taxes. Michael Kinsley has said that there would be no net new funds for investment, because any money diverted into private accounts would produce a dollar-for-dollar increase in the federal government's borrowing from other sources to cover its general deficit. [ 121 ]\nMeanwhile, some investment-minded observers among those who do not support privatization, point out potential pitfalls to the Trust Fund's undiversified portfolio, containing only treasuries. Many of these support the government itself investing the Trust Fund into other securities, to help boost the system's overall soundness through diversification , in a plan similar to CalPERS in the state of California . Among the proponents of this idea were some members of President Bill Clinton 's 1996 Social Security commission that studied the issue; the majority of the group supported partial privatization, and other members put forth the idea that Social Security funds should themselves be invested in the private markets to gain a higher rate of return. [ 120 ]\nAnother criticism of privatization is that while it might theoretically relieve the government of financial responsibility, in practice for every winner from moving risk from the collective to the individual there will be a loser, and the government will be held politically responsible for preventing those losers from slipping into poverty .  Proponents of the current system suspect that for the individuals whose risks turn out badly, these same individuals will support political action to raise state benefits, such that the risks such individuals may be willing to take under a privatized system are not without moral hazard .\nRole of government\nThere are also substantive issues that do not involve economics , but rather the role of government. Conservative Nobel Prize –winning economist Gary S. Becker , currently a graduate professor at the University of Chicago , wrote in a February 15, 2005 article that \"[privatization] reduce[s] the role of government in determining retirement ages and incomes, and improve[s] government accounting of revenues and spending obligations\". [ 126 ] He compares the privatization of Social Security to the privatization of the steel industry, citing similar \"excellent reasons\".\nManagement costs of private funds\nOpponents of privatization also decry the increased management costs that any privatized system will incur. Dishonest schemes can be sold to naive buyers in which pension values are bled through fees and commissions such as happened in the UK in 1988–1993. [ 127 ]\nSince the U.S. system is passively managed—with no specific funds being tied to specific investments within individual accounts, and with the system's surpluses being automatically invested only in treasuries—its management costs are very low.\nAdvocates of privatization at the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank, counter that, \"Based on existing private pension plans, it appears reasonable to assume that the costs of administering a well-run system of PRAs might be anywhere from a low of roughly 15 basis points (0.15%) to a high of roughly 50 basis points (0.5%).\" [ 128 ] They also point to the low costs of index funds (funds whose value rises or falls according to a particular financial index), including an S&P 500 index fund whose management fees run between 8 basis point (0.08%) and 10 basis points (0.10%). [ 129 ]\nPotential windfall for Wall Street\nOpponents also claim that privatization will bring a windfall for Wall Street brokerages and mutual fund companies, who will rake in billions of dollars in management fees. [ citation needed ]\nAustan Goolsbee at the University of Chicago has written a study, \"The Fees of Private Accounts and the Impact of Social Security Privatization on Financial Managers\", which calculates that, \"Under Plan II of the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security (CSSS), the net present value (NPV) of such payments would be $940 billion\", and, \"amounts to about one-quarter (25%) of the NPV of the revenue of the entire financial sector for the next 75 years\", and concludes that, \"The fees would be the largest windfall gain in American financial history\". [ 130 ]\nOther analysts argue that dangers of a Wall Street windfall of such magnitude are being vastly overstated. Rob Mills, vice-president of the brokerage industry trade group Securities Industry Association , calculated in a report published in December 2004 that the proposed private accounts might generate $39 billion in fees, in NPV terms, over the next 75 years. This amount would represent only 1.2% of the sector's projected NPV revenues of $3.3 trillion over that timeframe. He concludes that privatization is \"hardly likely to be a bonanza for Wall Street\". [ 131 ]\nOther reform proposals\nA range of other proposals have been suggested for partial choice, such as the 7.65% Solution . One, suggested by a number of Republican candidates during the 2000 elections, would set aside an initially small but increasing percentage of each worker's payroll tax into a fund, which the worker would be allowed to invest in securities. Another eliminated the Social Security payroll tax completely for workers born after a certain date, and allowed workers of different ages different periods of time during which they could opt to not pay the payroll tax, in exchange for a proportional delay in their receipt of payouts.\nMost state pension plans invest a portion of employer and employee contributions in a mixture of stocks, bonds, real estate, etc., which they or professional fund managers invest on behalf of the employees, without creating individual investment accounts. [ 132 ] [ 133 ]\nGeorge W. Bush's personal accounts proposal\nPresident George W. Bush discussed the \"partial privatization\" of Social Security since the beginning of his presidency in 2001. [ 134 ] But only after winning re-election in 2004 did he begin to invest his political capital in pursuing changes in earnest.\nIn May 2001, he announced establishment of a 16-member bipartisan commission \"to study and report specific recommendations to preserve Social Security for seniors while building wealth for younger Americans\", with the specific directive that it consider only how to incorporate individually controlled, voluntary personal retirement accounts . [ 135 ] The majority of members serving on Bill Clinton 's similar Social Security commission in 1996 had recommended through their own report that partial privatization be implemented. [ 120 ] Bush's Commission to Strengthen Social Security (CSSS) issued a report in December 2001 (revised in March 2002), which proposed three alternative plans for partial privatization:\nPlan I : Up to two percent of taxable wages could be diverted from FICA and voluntarily placed by workers into private accounts for investment in stocks, bonds, and/or mutual funds.\nPlan II : Up to four percent of taxable wages, up to a maximum of $1,000, could be diverted from FICA and voluntarily placed by workers into private accounts for investment.\nPlan III : One percent of wages on top of FICA, and 2.5% diverted from FICA up to a maximum of $1000, could be voluntarily placed by workers into private accounts for investment. [ 136 ]\nOn February 2, 2005, Bush made Social Security a prominent theme of his State of the Union Address . In this speech, which sparked the debate, it was Plan II of CSSS's report that Bush outlined as the starting point for changes in Social Security. He outlined, in general terms, a proposal based on partial privatization. After a phase-in period, workers currently less than 55 years old would have the option to set aside four percentage points of their payroll taxes in individual accounts that could be invested in the private sector, in \"a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds\". Workers making such a choice might receive larger or smaller benefits than if they had not done so, [ citation needed ] depending on the performance of the investments they selected.\nAlthough Bush described the Social Security system as \"headed for bankruptcy \", his proposal would not affect the projected shortfall in Social Security tax receipts. Reform would mean that some workers would pay less into the system's general fund and receive less back from it. Administration officials said that the proposal would have a \"net neutral effect\" on the system's financial situation, and that Bush would discuss with Congress how to fill the projected shortfall. [ 137 ] The Congressional Budget Office had previously analyzed the commission's \"Plan II\" (the plan most similar to Bush's proposal) and had concluded that the individual accounts would have little or no overall effect on the system's solvency, and that virtually all the savings would come instead from changing the benefits formula. [ 138 ]\nAs illustrated by the CBO analysis, one possible approach to the shortfall would be benefit cuts that would affect all retirees, not just those choosing the private accounts. Bush alluded to this option, mentioning some suggestions that he linked to various former Democratic officeholders. He did not endorse any specific benefit cuts himself, however. He said only, \"All these ideas are on the table.\" He expressed his opposition to any increase in Social Security taxes. Later that month, his press secretary, Scott McClellan , ambiguously characterized raising or eliminating the cap on income subject to the tax as a tax increase that Bush would oppose. [ 139 ]\nIn his speech, Bush did not address the issue of how the system would continue to provide benefits for current and near-future retirees if some of the incoming Social Security tax receipts were to be diverted into private accounts. A few days later, however, Vice-President Dick Cheney stated that the plan would require borrowing $758 billion over the period 2005 to 2014; that estimate has been criticized as being unrealistically low. [ 140 ]\nOn April 28, 2005, Bush held a televised press conference at which he provided additional detail about the proposal he favored. For the first time, he endorsed reducing the benefits that some retirees would receive. He endorsed a plan from Robert Pozen , described below in the section regarding suggestions for Social Security that do not involve privatization.\nAlthough Bush's State of the Union speech left many important aspects of his proposal unspecified, debate began on the basis of the broad outline he had given.\nPolitics of the dispute over Bush's proposal\nThe issue gained increasing political scrutiny since George W. Bush mentioned changing Social Security during the 2004 elections , and since he made it clear in his nationally televised January 2005 speech that he intended to work to partially privatize the system during his second term.\nTo assist the effort, Republican donors were asked after the election to help raise $50 million or more for a campaign in support of the proposal, with contributions expected from such sources as the fiscally conservative 501(c)4 organization Club for Growth and the securities industry. [ 141 ] In 1983, a Cato Institute paper had noted that privatization would require \"mobilizing the various coalitions that stand to benefit from the change...the business community, and financial institutions in particular\". [ 142 ] Soon after Bush's State of the Union speech, the Club for Growth began running television advertisements in the districts of Republican members of Congress whom it identified as undecided on the issue. [ 143 ]\nA group backed by labor unions called \"Americans United to Protect Social Security\" \"set its sights on killing Bush's privatization plan and silencing his warnings that Social Security was 'headed toward bankruptcy.'\" [ citation needed ]\nOn January 16, 2005, The New York Times reported internal Social Security Administration documents directing employees to disseminate the message that \"Social Security's long-term financing problems are serious and need to be addressed soon\", and to \"insert solvency messages in all Social Security publications\". [ 144 ]\nComing soon after the disclosure of government payments to commentator Armstrong Williams to promote the No Child Left Behind Act , the revelation prompted the objection from Dana C. Duggins, a vice president of the Social Security Council of the American Federation of Government Employees , that \"Trust fund dollars should not be used to promote a political agenda.\"\nIn the weeks following his State of the Union speech, Bush devoted considerable time and energy to campaigning for privatization. He held \"town meetings\" at many locations around the country. Attendance at these meetings was controlled to ensure that the crowds would be supportive of Bush's plan. In Denver , for example, three people who had obtained tickets through Representative Bob Beauprez , a Republican, were nevertheless ejected from the meeting before Bush appeared, because they had arrived at the event in a car with a bumper sticker reading \"No More Blood for Oil\". [ 145 ]\nOpponents of Bush's plan have analogized his dire predictions about Social Security to similar statements that he made to muster support for the 2003 Invasion of Iraq . [ 146 ]\nA dispute between the AARP and a conservative group for older Americans, USA Next , cropped up around the time of the State of the Union speech. The AARP had supported Bush's plan for major changes in Medicare in 2003, but it opposed his Social Security privatization initiative. In January 2005, before the State of the Union Address, the AARP ran advertisements attacking the idea. In response, USA Next launched a campaign against AARP. Charlie Jarvis of USA Next stated: \"They [AARP] are the boulder in the middle of the highway to personal savings accounts. We will be the dynamite that removes them.\" [ 147 ]\nThe tone of the debate between these two interest groups is merely one example among many of the tone of many of the debates, discussions, columns, advertisements , articles, letters, and white papers that Bush's proposal, to touch the \"third rail\", has sparked among politicians, pundits, thinktankers, and taxpayers.\nImmediately after Bush's State of the Union speech, a national poll brought some good news for each side of the controversy. [ 148 ] Only 17% of the respondents thought the Social Security system was \"in a state of crisis\", but 55% thought it had \"major problems\". The general idea of allowing private investments was favored by 40% and opposed by 55%. Specific proposals that received more support than opposition (in each case by about a two-to-one ratio) were \"Limiting benefits for wealthy retirees\" and \"Requiring higher income workers to pay Social Security taxes on ALL of their wages\". The poll was conducted by USA Today , CNN , and the Gallup Organization .\nBush's April press conference detailed the proposal further, with Bush describing his preference in \"a reform system should protect those who depend on Social Security the most\" and describing his proposal as \"a Social Security system in the future where benefits for low-income workers will grow faster than benefits for people who are better off.\" [ 149 ] Opponents countered that middle-class retirees would experience cuts, and that those below the poverty line would receive only what they are entitled to under current law. [ 150 ] Democrats also expressed concern that a Social Security system that primarily benefited the poor would have less widespread political support. [ 151 ] Finally, the issue of private accounts continued to be a divisive one. Many legislators remained opposed or dubious, while Bush, in his press conference, said he felt strongly about the point.\nDespite Bush's emphasis on the issue, many Republicans in Congress were not enthusiastic about his proposal, and Democrats were unanimously opposed. [ 152 ] In late May 2005, House Majority Whip Roy Blunt listed the \"priority legislation\" to be acted on after Memorial Day ; Social Security was not included, [ 153 ] and Bush's proposal was considered by many to be dead. [ 154 ] [ 155 ] In September, some Congressional Republicans pointed to the budgetary problems caused by Hurricane Katrina as a further obstacle to acting on the Bush proposal. [ 156 ] Congress did not enact any major changes to Social Security in 2005, or before its pre-election adjournment in 2006.\nDuring the campaigning for the 2006 midterm election , Bush stated that reviving his proposal for privatizing Social Security would be one of his top two priorities for his last two years in office. [ 157 ] In 2007, he continued to pursue that goal by nominating Andrew Biggs, a privatization advocate and former researcher for the Cato Institute, to be deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration. When the Senate did not confirm Biggs, Bush made a recess appointment , enabling Biggs to hold the post without Senate confirmation until December 2008. [ 158 ] During his last days in office, Bush said that spurring the debate on Social Security was his most effective achievement during his presidency. [ 159 ]\nOther concerns\nSome [ 160 ] alleged that George W. Bush was opposed to Social Security on ideological grounds, regarding it as a form of governmental redistribution of income, which other groups such as libertarians strongly oppose. [ 161 ] Some of the critics of Bush's plan argued that its real purpose was not to save the current Social Security system, but to lay the groundwork for dismantling it. They note that, in 2000, when Bush was asked about a possible transition to a fully privatized system, he replied: \"It's going to take a while to transition to a system where personal savings accounts are the predominant part of the investment vehicle...This is a step toward a completely different world, and an important step.\" [ 162 ] His comment is consonant [ citation needed ] with the Cato Institute 's reference in 1983 to a \" Leninist strategy\" for \" guerrilla warfare \" against both the current Social Security system and the coalition that supports it.\" [ 163 ]\nCritics of the system, such as Nobel Laureate economist Milton Friedman , have said that Social Security redistributes wealth from the poor to the wealthy. [ 164 ] Workers must pay 12.4%, including a 6.2% employer contribution, on their wages below the Social Security Wage Base ($102,000 in 2008), but no tax on income in excess of this amount. [ 165 ] Therefore, high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income, resulting in a regressive tax . The benefit paid to each worker is also calculated using the wage base on which the tax was paid. Changing the system to tax all earnings without increasing the benefit wage base would result in the system being a progressive tax . Reason magazine has said that Social Security should be abolished altogether stating:\nSocial Security is not a retirement fund—it's a transfer program, taking income from the payrolls of current workers and giving it to retirees. Generally, these retirees are already wealthier than the workers subsidizing them. Social Security's retirement payments (Old-Age and Survivors Insurance) should be phased out because of the program's unsustainable and regressive nature, freeing workers to better use their earnings to plan for their own retirement. [ 166 ]\nFurthermore, wealthier individuals generally have higher life expectancies and thus may expect to receive larger benefits for a longer period than poorer taxpayers, often minorities. [ 167 ] A single individual who dies before age 62, who is more likely to be poor, receives no retirement benefits despite years of paying Social Security tax. On the other hand, an individual who lives to age 100, who is more likely to be wealthy, is guaranteed payments that are more than he or she paid into the system. [ 168 ]\nA factor working against wealthier individuals and in favor of the poor with little other retirement income is that Social Security benefits become subject to federal income tax based on income. The portion varies with income level, 50% at $32,000 rising to 85% at $44,000 for married couples in 2008. This does not just affect those that continue to work after retirement. Unearned income withdrawn from tax deferred retirement accounts, like IRAs and 401(k)s , counts towards taxation of benefits.\nCritics claimed that Social Security's rate of return is lower than private capital markets. [ 169 ]\nEffects of the gift to the first generation\nIt has been argued that the first generation of social security participants have, in effect, received a large gift, because they received far more benefits than they paid into the system. The term associated with this historical imbalance has been coined \"legacy debt\". [ 170 ] [ circular reference ] [ 171 ] [ circular reference ] Robert J. Shiller noted that \"the initial designers of the Social Security System in 1935 had envisioned the building of a large trust fund\", but \"the 1939 amendments and subsequent changes prevented this from happening\". [ 172 ]\nAs such, the gift to the first generation is necessarily borne by subsequent generations. In this pay-as-you-go system, current workers are paying the benefits of the previous generation, instead of investing for their own retirement, [ 172 ] and therefore, attempts at privatizing Social Security could result in workers having to pay twice: once to fund the benefits of current retirees, and a second time to fund their own retirement.\nPyramid- or Ponzi-scheme similarities\nCritics have asserted that the funding mechanism of Social Security's pay-as-you-go funding mechanism has similarities with an illegal Ponzi scheme , where early investors are paid off out of the funds collected from later investors instead of from profits from business activity. In particular, they describe a sustainability problem that they say happens when the number of new contributors declines. [ 120 ] [ 173 ] [ 174 ]\nWilliam G. Shipman of the Cato Institute argues:\nIn common usage a trust fund is an estate of money and securities held in trust for its beneficiaries . The Social Security Trust Fund is quite different. It is an accounting of the difference between tax and benefit flows. When taxes exceed benefits, the federal government lends itself the excess in return for an interest-paying bond, an IOU that it issues to itself. The government then spends its new funds on unrelated projects such as bridge repairs, defense, or food stamps. The funds are not invested for the benefit of present or future retirees. [ 175 ]\nThis criticism is not new. In his 1936 presidential campaign , Republican Alf Landon called the trust fund \"a cruel hoax\". The Republican's party platform that year stated, \"The so-called reserve fund estimated at forty-seven billion dollars for old age insurance is no reserve at all, because the fund will contain nothing but the Government's promise to pay, while the taxes collected in the guise of premiums will be wasted by the Government in reckless and extravagant political schemes.\" [ 176 ]\nAs of 2009, the Social Security Administration responded to the criticism as follows:\nThere is a superficial analogy between pyramid or Ponzi schemes and pay-as-you-go insurance programs in that in both money from later participants goes to pay the benefits of earlier participants. But that is where the similarity ends. A pay-as-you-go system can be visualized as a simple pipeline, with money from current contributors coming in the front end and money to current beneficiaries paid out the back end. As long as the amount of money coming in the front end of the pipe maintains a rough balance with the money paid out, the system can continue forever. There is no unsustainable progression driving the mechanism of a pay-as-you-go pension system, and so it is not a pyramid or Ponzi scheme.\nIf the demographics of the population were stable, then a pay-as-you-go system would not have demographically-driven financing ups and downs, and no thoughtful person would be tempted to compare it to a Ponzi arrangement. However, since population demographics tend to rise and fall, the balance in pay-as-you-go systems tends to rise and fall as well. This vulnerability to demographic ups and downs is one of the problems with pay-as-you-go financing. But this problem has nothing to do with Ponzi schemes or any other fraudulent form of financing; it is simply the nature of pay-as-you-go systems. [ 177 ]\nIn March 2025, Elon Musk called social security a Ponzi scheme.

The ASL-3 Security Standard involves increased internal security measures that make it harder to steal model weights, while the corresponding Deployment Standard covers a narrowly targeted set of deployment measures designed to limit the risk of Claude being misused specifically for the development or acquisition of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons. These measures should not lead Claude to refuse queries except on a very narrow set of topics.\n\nWe are deploying Claude Opus 4 with our ASL-3 measures as a precautionary and provisional action. To be clear, we have not yet determined whether Claude Opus 4 has definitively passed the Capabilities Threshold that requires ASL-3 protections. Rather, due to continued improvements in CBRN-related knowledge and capabilities, we have determined that clearly ruling out ASL-3 risks is not possible for Claude Opus 4 in the way it was for every previous model, and more detailed study is required to conclusively assess the model’s level of risk. (We have ruled out that Claude Opus 4 needs the ASL-4 Standard, as required by our RSP, and, similarly, we have ruled out that Claude Sonnet 4 needs the ASL-3 Standard.)\n\nDangerous capability evaluations of AI models are inherently challenging , and as models approach our thresholds of concern, it takes longer to determine their status. Proactively enabling a higher standard of safety and security simplifies model releases while allowing us to learn from experience by iteratively improving our defenses and reducing their impact on users.\nThis post and the accompanying report discuss the new measures and the rationale behind them.\n\nBackground\nIncreasingly capable AI models warrant increasingly strong deployment and security protections. This principle is core to Anthropic’s Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP). 1\nDeployment measures target specific categories of misuse; in particular, our RSP focuses on reducing the risk that models could be misused for attacks with the most dangerous categories of weapons–CBRN.\nSecurity controls aim to prevent the theft of model weights–the essence of the AI’s intelligence and capability.\nAnthropic’s RSP includes Capability Thresholds for models: if models reach those thresholds (or if we have not yet determined that they are sufficiently far below them), we are required to implement a higher level of AI Safety Level Standards . Until now, all our models have been deployed under the baseline protections of the AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) Standard. ASL-2 deployment measures include training models to refuse dangerous CBRN-related requests. ASL-2 security measures include defenses against opportunistic attempts to steal the weights. The ASL-3 Standard requires a higher level of defense against both deployment and security threats, suitable against sophisticated non-state attackers.\nRationale\nWe have not yet determined whether Claude Opus 4 capabilities actually require the protections of the ASL-3 Standard. So why did we implement those protections now? We anticipated that we might do this when we launched our last model, Claude Sonnet 3.7. In that case, we determined that the model did not require the protections of the ASL-3 Standard. But we acknowledged the very real possibility that given the pace of progress, near future models might warrant these enhanced measures. 2 And indeed, in the lead up to releasing Claude Opus 4, we proactively decided to launch it under the ASL-3 Standard. This approach allowed us to focus on developing, testing, and refining these protections before we needed them.\nThis approach is also consistent with the RSP, which allows us to err on the side of caution and deploy a model under a higher standard than we are sure is needed. In this case, that meant proactively carrying out the ASL-3 Security and Deployment Standards (and ruling out the need for even more advanced protections). We will continue to evaluate Claude Opus 4’s CBRN capabilities. If we conclude that Claude Opus 4 has not surpassed the relevant Capability Threshold, then we may remove or adjust the ASL-3 protections.\nDeployment Measures\nThe new ASL-3 deployment measures are narrowly focused on preventing the model from assisting with CBRN-weapons related tasks of concern, 3 and specifically from assisting with extended, end-to-end CBRN workflows in a way that is additive to what is already possible without large language models. This includes limiting universal jailbreaks —systematic attacks that allow attackers to circumvent our guardrails and consistently extract long chains of workflow-enhancing CBRN-related information. Consistent with our underlying threat models, ASL-3 deployment measures do not aim to address issues unrelated to CBRN, to defend against non-universal jailbreaks, or to prevent the extraction of commonly available single pieces of information, such as the answer to, “What is the chemical formula for sarin?” (although they may incidentally prevent this). Given the evolving threat landscape, we expect that new jailbreaks will be discovered and that we will need to rapidly iterate and improve our systems over time.\nWe have developed a three-part approach: making the system more difficult to jailbreak, detecting jailbreaks when they do occur, and iteratively improving our defenses.\nMaking the system more difficult to jailbreak. We have implemented Constitutional Classifiers —a system where real-time classifier guards, trained on synthetic data representing harmful and harmless CBRN-related prompts and completions, monitor model inputs and outputs and intervene to block a narrow class of harmful CBRN information. Our pre-production testing suggests we can substantially reduce jailbreaking success while adding only moderate compute overhead (additional processing costs beyond what is required for model inference) to normal operations.\nDetecting jailbreaks when they occur. We have also instituted a wider monitoring system including a bug bounty program focused on stress-testing our Constitutional Classifiers, offline classification systems, and threat intelligence partnerships to quickly identify and respond to potential universal jailbreaks that would enable CBRN misuse.\nIteratively improving our defenses. We believe we can rapidly remediate jailbreaks using methods including generating synthetic jailbreaks that resemble those we discovered and using those data to train a new classifier.\nAll these measures will require ongoing refinement, both to improve their effectiveness and because they may still occasionally affect legitimate queries (that is, they may produce false positives). 4 Nevertheless, they represent a substantial advance in defending against catastrophic misuse of AI capabilities. 5\nSecurity\nOur targeted security controls are focused on protecting model weights—the critical numerical parameters that, if compromised, could allow users to access our models without deployment protections. Our approach involves more than 100 different security controls that combine preventive controls with detection mechanisms, primarily targeting threats from sophisticated non-state actors 6 from initial entry points through lateral movement to final extraction. Many of these controls, such as two-party authorization for model weight access, enhanced change management protocols, and endpoint software controls through binary allowlisting, are examples of following the best practices established by other security-conscious organizations.\n\nOne control in particular, however, is more unique to the goal of protecting model weights: we have implemented preliminary egress bandwidth controls. Egress bandwidth controls restrict the flow of data out of secure computing environments where AI model weights reside. The combined weights of a model are substantial in size. By limiting the rate of outbound network traffic, these controls can leverage model weight size to create a security advantage. When potential exfiltration of model weights is detected through unusual bandwidth usage, security systems can block the suspicious traffic. Over time, we expect to get to the point where rate limits are low enough that exfiltrating model weights before being detected is very difficult—even if an attacker has otherwise significantly compromised our systems. Implementing egress bandwidth controls has been a forcing function to understand and govern the way in which data is flowing outside of our internal systems, which has yielded benefits for our detection and response capabilities.\n\nAs with the deployment protections, we are continuing to work on improving the coverage and maturity of our security controls, always taking into account the evolving threat landscape. In particular, we will continue improving our egress controls, mitigations against more sophisticated insider threats, and our overall security posture.\nConclusions\nAs we have emphasized above, the question of which deployment and security measures to apply to frontier AI models is far from solved. We will continue to introspect, iterate, and improve. The practical experience of operating under the ASL-3 Standards will help us uncover new and perhaps unexpected issues and opportunities.\nWe will continually work with others in the AI industry, users of Claude, and partners in government and civil society to improve our methods of guarding these models. We hope that our detailed report will be of use to others in the AI industry attempting to implement similar protections and help us all prepare for the promise and challenge of even more capable AI.\nRead the full report .\nFootnotes\n1 The RSP is only one component of our approach to mitigating potential risks.\n2 In particular, we had some evidence of improved CBRN-related capabilities. Experiments showed that access to Claude Sonnet 3.7 helped participants do somewhat better on tasks related to CBRN weapon acquisition than those with standard internet access (although all participants’ plans still had critical failures). Model performance on evaluations like the Virology Capabilities Test had been steadily increasing over time.\n3 Initially they are focused exclusively on biological weapons as we believe these account for the vast majority of the risk, although we are evaluating a potential expansion in scope to some other CBRN threats.\n4 We have also established access control systems so that users with dual-use science and technology applications may be vetted to receive targeted exemptions from some classifier actions.\n5 For more information on our assessment of the effectiveness and sufficiency of these measures, see the ASL-3 Deployment Safeguards Report .\n6 Nation-state threats (other than those using non-novel attack chains) and sophisticated insider risk are out of the scope of the ASL-3 Standard.\n\nNews\nHow enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "4371c166f26b1b9a42e134a8187a29beccd70585732b0b0285eee97038d54051", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 2808, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 25172, "ratings": []}

These safeguards are part of the advanced protections we’ve developed to help us meet the AI Safety Level-3 (ASL-3) Deployment Standard as part of our Responsible Scaling Policy , the framework that governs how we develop and deploy increasingly capable AI models safely.\nThe bug bounty program, which is in partnership with HackerOne , will test an updated version of our Constitutional Classifiers system. Constitutional Classifiers are a technique we built to guard against jailbreaks that could elicit information related to CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) weapons. This system follows a list of principles that define what type of content should and shouldn’t be allowed when interacting with Claude, and focus narrowly on specific harms.\nParticipants will receive early access to test our classifiers on Claude 3.7 Sonnet. We’re offering bounty rewards up to $25,000 for verified universal jailbreaks found on the unreleased system. A universal jailbreak is a vulnerability that consistently bypasses Claude’s safety measures across many topics. For this initiative, we're interested in universal jailbreaks that could be exploited to enable misuse on CBRN-related topics.\nOur models are becoming increasingly capable, and as we’ve shared before , we believe some future models may require the advanced ASL-3 security and safety protections outlined in our Responsible Scaling Policy. This bug bounty initiative will help contribute to the work we’ve done over the last several months to iterate and stress-test our ASL-3 safeguards.\nWe’ve kicked off this new bug bounty initiative with participation from the researchers who joined our earlier program last year and are offering the opportunity for new researchers to participate. If you're an experienced red teamer or have demonstrated expertise in identifying jailbreaks in language models, we encourage you to apply for an invitation through our application form . Detailed instructions and feedback will be shared with selected participants. Applications open today, and the program will run through Sunday, May 18. This initiative is invite-only so we can respond to submissions with timely feedback.\nWe're grateful to the security community for its partnership in helping us make AI systems safer.\nUpdate on May 22, 2025\nThe bug bounty program in this post has concluded. Participants will transition to a new bug bounty initiative we’re rolling out today that’s focused on stress-testing our Constitutional Classifiers system on the new Claude Opus 4 model and testing other safety systems we may develop. We’re still accepting applications to participate in this new invite-only program. You can apply for an invite through our application form .\nTo further advance AI safety, we are also accepting reports of universal jailbreaks for ASL-3 uses of concern (meaning those which elicit information related to biological threats) found on public platforms or forums, such as social media.

Today, we're sharing insights into our evolving approach to assessing and mitigating various harms that could result from our systems, ranging from catastrophic scenarios like biological threats to critical concerns like child safety, disinformation and fraud.\nWhy is this approach important? As models continue to evolve, we need more comprehensive ways to think about and manage their potential impacts. We believe that considering different types of harms in a structured way helps us better understand the challenges ahead and informs our thinking about responsible AI development.\nOur approach complements our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP) , which focuses specifically on catastrophic risks. Identifying and addressing the full range of potential impacts requires a broader perspective. That's why we've built out a more comprehensive framework to assess harm that we can then proportionately manage and mitigate.\n*Important note : This approach is still evolving. We're sharing our current thinking while acknowledging it will continue to develop as we learn more. We welcome collaboration from across the AI ecosystem as we work to make these systems benefit humanity.\nBreaking down our approach:\nWe've developed an approach that helps our teams communicate clearly, make well-reasoned decisions, and develop targeted solutions for both known and emergent harms. This approach is designed to be both principled and adaptable to keep up with the evolving AI landscape. We examine potential AI impacts across multiple baseline dimensions, with room to grow and expand over time:\nPhysical impacts: Effects on bodily health and well-being\nPsychological impacts: Effects on mental health and cognitive functioning\nEconomic impacts: Financial consequences and property considerations\nSocietal impacts: Effects on communities, institutions, and shared systems\nIndividual autonomy impacts: Effects on personal decision-making and freedoms\nFor each dimension, we consider factors like likelihood, scale, affected populations, duration, causality, technology contribution, and mitigation feasibility. This helps us understand the real-world significance of different potential impacts.\nDepending on harm type and severity, we address and manage risks through a variety of policies and practices including developing and maintaining a comprehensive Usage Policy , conducting evaluations (including red teaming and adversarial testing) before and after launch, sophisticated detection techniques to spot misuse and abuse, and robust enforcement ranging from prompt modifications to account blocking. This perspective helps us balance multiple considerations: addressing harms with proportionate safeguards while maintaining the helpfulness and functionality of our systems in everyday use cases. We’re excited to share more about this work in the near future.\nSome examples of how we’ve used our framework to inform our understanding of harm\nWhen exploring new capabilities or features, we examine how they might introduce additional considerations across different harm dimensions. For example: Computer Use: As our models develop the ability to interact with computer interfaces, we consider factors like the types of software AI systems might interact with and the contexts in which these interactions occur, which helps us identify where additional safeguards might be beneficial. For computer use, we specifically examine a multitude of risks including those related to financial software and banking platforms where unauthorized automation could potentially facilitate fraud or manipulation, and communication tools where AI systems could be used for targeted influence operations or phishing campaigns. This analysis helps us develop approaches that maintain the utility of these capabilities while incorporating appropriate monitoring and enforcement to prevent misuse. For example, our initial work on computer use functionality led us to design more stringent enforcement thresholds and employ novel approaches to enforcement such as hierarchical summarization that allows us to detect harms while maintaining our privacy standards.\nModel Response Boundaries: When considering how models should respond to different types of user requests, we've found value in examining tradeoffs between helpfulness and appropriate limitations. Models that are trained to be more helpful and responsive to user requests may also lean towards harmful behaviors (e.g., sharing information that violates our AUP or could be used in dangerous ways). Conversely, models that over-index on harmlessness can tend towards not sharing any information with users, even when requests are harmless. By thinking about both individual and societal impacts, we can better understand where to focus our safety evaluations and training. For example, with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, we evaluated different types of requests along this spectrum and improved how our model handles ambiguous prompts by encouraging safe, helpful responses rather than simply refusing to engage. This resulted in a 45% reduction in unnecessary refusals while maintaining strong safeguards against truly harmful content. This approach helps us make more nuanced decisions about model behavior, particularly in scenarios where certain vulnerable populations—such as children, marginalized communities, or individuals in crisis—might be at heightened risk.\nLooking ahead\nThere's still a lot to do. Our approach to understanding and addressing harms is just one input into our overall safety strategy, but we think it represents a useful step toward more systematic thinking about AI impacts.\nAs AI systems become more capable, we expect new challenges will emerge that we haven't yet anticipated. We're committed to evolving our approach alongside these developments, including adapting our frameworks, refining our assessment methods, and learning from both successes and failures along the way.\nWe know we can't do this work alone. We invite researchers, policy experts, and industry partners to collaborate with us as we continue exploring these important questions. You can connect with us on these issues via usersafety@anthropic.com .\n\nNews\nHow enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "00721de29f8753f8d5b0528d40f877d3cb3bc82707044ce6249362928ca3ab2b", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 1637, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 15000, "ratings": []}

Most of those Huawei semiconductors would be delivered within China, he added.\n“It’s critical for us not to have a false sense of security, to understand that China is catching up quickly, but that is our projection for this year,” said Kessler, who oversees US export control programs. “We shouldn’t take too much comfort in the fact that China’s production of these advanced chips is relatively small, because we know they have global ambitions.”\nThe market for AI accelerators in China was about 1.5 million in 2024, according to the market research firm TechInsights. The country also needs tens of millions of high-end chips for smartphones made by Huawei and other domestic players. For reference, the Stargate data-center project in Texas backed by SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI is projected to eventually hold Bloomberg Terminal about 500,000 chips\nKessler spoke Thursday before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee where he argued for increased funding for export controls programs run by the Bureau of Industry and Security, including a more than doubling for enforcement. With the additional money, BIS could hire 200 export enforcement special agents in the US and more than double the number of overseas export control officers, from 12 to 30 people.\n“It’s time for BIS to have the resources that it needs to do its job,” Kessler said.\nKessler’s agency has been at the center of US efforts to curtail China’s technology advances. The Biden administration imposed several rounds of export controls on Nvidia Corp. ’s artificial-intelligence chips and other advanced technologies, and President Donald Trump’s team has largely continued with — and built upon — those restrictions.\nThose export restrictions have emerged as a flash point between the world’s two largest economies, with China objecting to American controls on advanced technology and the US concerned over a crackdown by Beijing on critical minerals sales. High-level talks this week in London yielded a new trade framework that Trump has said would resume rare earths exports to the US.\nTrump to Rewrite AI Chip Curbs Reviled by Nvidia and US Allies\nUS Plans Wider China Tech Curbs Targeting Subsidiaries\nLutnick Urges Tougher Enforcement of Export Curbs on China\nUS Tightens Curbs on China’s Access to AI Memory, Chip Tools\nAsked by lawmakers about the negotiations, Kessler said he was present in London for parts of the talks, but declined to elaborate. Details of the accord have not been made public, though US officials have signaled a willingness to ease recent curbs on sales of chip-design software.\nDuring his roughly 90-minute appearance, Kessler also faulted the so-called AI diffusion rule governing advanced chips that was issued during the Biden administration’s’ final days, calling the measure “problematic” and a source of tension with US allies. The Commerce Department revoked the rule last month and Trump officials are now working on a new approach.\nKessler said there’s no question that US semiconductors are being illicitly smuggled into banned countries, including China. That directly contradicts the stance of Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, who said in May that there’s “no evidence of any AI chip diversion.”\nAt the hearing, the subcommittee’s Republican Chair Bill Huizenga told Kessler that there are some people who “deny that this smuggling is happening at all.”\n“It’s happening,” Kessler replied. “It’s a fact.”\n“We do see significant efforts by wrongdoers to divert AI chips as well as other products,” he said later. “This budget is intended to enable us to capture, to catch more of it and prevent more wrongdoing.”\nChina Hit World’s Pain Point on Trade — and Will Do So Again\nUS Makes Export Controls Negotiable as Part of China Trade Talks\nWhy Rare Earths Are China’s Trump Card in Trade War: QuickTake\nTrump Says China Will Ship Rare Earths in ‘Done’ Trade Deal\nKessler left open the possibility of invoking the foreign direct product rule, a sweeping authority that lets his agency impose controls on goods made abroad using even the tiniest amount of American technology. The Biden administration had considered but ultimately decided against using the FDPR to prevent ASML Holding NV and Tokyo Electron from repairing chipmaking machinery in China, a move that would have inflamed tensions with the Netherlands and Japan.\nThe US prefers that allies cooperate on security interests including export controls, but failing that the FDPR remains as an option, he said.\n“I would consider using the foreign direct product rule” he said. “It’s an important tool in our toolkit to make sure that there isn’t backfilling.”\nKessler said he was ending the previous practice under the Biden administration of granting licenses for American companies to do business with blacklisted entities. He was asked specifically about BIS granting licenses worth billions of dollars for work with Huawei and Semiconductor International Manufacturing Corp. , or SMIC, the Shanghai-based company that has produced chips for Huawei.\n“Let me be unequivocal, that has stopped and it will not resume,” he said.\nCommerce Department officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment clarifying whether licenses for Huawei and SMIC had been cut off.\n(Updates with China AI chip market size in fourth paragraph)\nGet Alerts for:\nIn this Article", "content_hash": "6543cde945d4b27071004721fe57f4753d68d2b4d5ee069005fb893731f85eaa", "source_domain": "www.bloomberg.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 1655, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 18178, "ratings": []}

That’s why we’re helping communities use data science to improve civic outcomes, assisting cultural institutions to engage a wider audience through technology, and ensuring students learn the coding, technical and soft skills they need to unlock opportunity and drive progress in an increasingly digital world.\nThe Power of “AND”: At Bloomberg, Open Source and Corporate Philanthropy Work Hand-in-Hand\nBloomberg Engineers Help Brooklyn Robotics Reach FIRST Worlds\nResults for America Awards 21 New Cities with the Bloomberg Philanthropies What Works Cities Certification for Exceptional Use of Data\nCelebrating the Q1 2025 recipients of Bloomberg’s FOSS Fund\nMake it happen here.\n\nPromoting an inclusive global economy\nEconomic inequality is one of the greatest challenges facing the global economy and presents a significant threat to its stability – particularly during times of crisis.

While we know that many readers of this page want to know our best-performing companies, it's important to us to be transparent about all our investments -- all founders we've backed are our customers.

If you're interested to know which companies the broader community finds most interesting, see our Wikipedia page .\nCurious why a founder would want to work with us , hear directly from them here or keep reading for a few excerpts:\nKieran Snyder, Textio : “Within a few minutes of meeting us -- at a time when we didn't yet have a product -- Roy made observations about our eventual go-to-market that were so insightful that we knew we had to work with him.”\nScott Heiferman, Meetup : \"Karin's been investing in the New York tech community since before it was cool, before it was big. Karin is a reason why New York is on the map in today's tech economy, she's in it for the long haul. She's always there for entrepreneurs.\"\nRyan Petersen, Flexport : \"I use [Roy's] advice really effectively, and it is part of why we're a shipping company that people have actually heard of is that we, I listened to Roy, and I did as he said, and I really, really appreciate it. It's not too many investors that really did something that lastingly contributed to the company's success.\nAnthony Goldbloom, Kaggle : \"The thing I loved most about working with Bloomberg Beta is that the advice I found and received wasn't just rehashed Silicon-Valley-conventional wisdom, but rather guidance that was creative and very much tailored to the specifics of my situation.”\nAmjad Masad, Replit : \"Roy took my meetings when others wouldn't open my emails. Without Bloomberg Beta's long-term view we wouldn't be where we are today.\"\nDavid Rogier, MasterClass : \"Bloomberg Beta has been there for us from the beginning. I still text and talk with James and Roy all the time. Not only are they really smart, they’re also good people.\"\nChristine Tao, Sounding Board : \"Bloomberg Beta...has their own perspectives and they're willing to invest and put their money behind founders without having to look at who else is in the round, or just following trends.\"\nLukas Biewald, Weights & Biases : \"James was my first choice of investors I wanted to work with in my second company because he's so good at pushing me to think clearly and so relentlessly positive and thoughtful.”\n* Exited\n** No longer in the portfolio\nEngineering\nInternships\nEmployee benefits\nMake it happen here.\nSearch jobs", "content_hash": "7479114ca85100fada245cbbf19b2ad571468247315430d1729b312a14fbb946", "source_domain": "www.bloomberg.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 886, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 18478, "ratings": []}

There are trade-offs, but given export controls and lackluster domestic yields, it’s clear that there are further loopholes in the Chinese export controls.\nGoogle AI Infrastructure Supremacy: Systems Matter More Than Microarchitecture\nWhile the Ascend chip can be fabricated at SMIC, we note that this is a global chip that has HBM from Korea , primary wafer production from TSMC , and is fabricated by 10s of billions of wafer fabrication equipment from the US, Netherlands, and Japan . We do a deep dive into what is possible for domestic Chinese production what is an aggressive skirting of the export controls, and why the US government needs to focus on these key new areas to limit China’s AI capabilities.\nFab Whack-A-Mole: Chinese Companies are Evading U.S. Sanctions\nHuawei is a generation behind in chips, but its scale-up solution is arguably a generation ahead of Nvidia and AMD’s current products on the market. So what would be the specifications for Huawei’s CloudMatrix 384 (CM384)?\nThe CloudMatrix 384 consists of 384 Ascend 910C chips connected through an all-to-all topology. The tradeoff is simple: having five times as many Ascends more than offsets each GPU being only one-third the performance of an Nvidia Blackwell.\nA full CloudMatrix system can now deliver 300 PFLOPs of dense BF16 compute, almost double that of the GB200 NVL72 . With more than 3.6x aggregate memory capacity and 2.1x more memory bandwidth , Huawei and China now have AI system capabilities that can beat Nvidia’s.\nWhat’s more, is the CM384 is uniquely suited to China’s strengths, which is domestic networking production, infrastructure software to prevent network failures, and with further yield improvements, an ability to scale up to even larger domains.\nThe drawback here is that it takes 4. 1 x the power of a GB200 NVL72 , with 2.5x worse power per FLOP , 1.9x worse power per TB/s memory bandwidth, and 1.2x worse power per TB HBM memory capacity.\nThe deficiencies in power are relevant but not a limiting factor in China.\nChina has No Power Constraints, just Silicon Constraints\nThe common refrain in the West is that AI is power-limited , but in China, this is the opposite. The West has spent the last decade shifting a primarily coal-based power infrastructure to greener natural gas and renewable power generation paired with more efficient energy usage on a per capita basis. This is the opposite in China, where rising lifestyles and continued heavy investment mean massive power generation demand.\nMost of this has been powered by coal, but China also has the largest install bases of solar, hydro, wind, and now is the leader in deploying nuclear. The United States just maintains the nuclear power deployed in the 1970s. Put simply, upgrading and adding capacity to the US energy grid is a lost muscle, meanwhile in China they have added an entire US grid of capacity since 2011, or approximately the last 10 years.\nIf you do not have a power constraint because of your relative power abundance, it makes sense to forgo power density and increase scale-up, including optics in the design. The CM384 design considers system-level constraints even outside of the rack, and we believe that it’s not just the relative power availability that constrains China’s AI ambitions. We think that there are multiple ways for continued scaling for Huawei’s solution.\nHow Many Ascend 910C and CloudMatrix 384 Can China Make?\nOne common misconception is that Huawei’s 910C is made in China. It is entirely designed there, but China still relies heavily on foreign production. Whether it be HBM from Samsung, wafers from TSMC, or equipment from America, Netherlands, and Japan, there is a big reliance on foreign industry.\nWhile SMIC, the largest foundry in China, does have 7nm, the vast majority of Ascend 910B and 910C are made with TSMC’s 7nm. In fact, the US Government, TechInsights, and others have acquired Ascend 910B and 910C and every single one used TSMC dies. Huawei was able to circumvent the sanctions on them against TSMC by purchasing ~$500 million of 7nm wafers through another company, Sophgo.\nTSMC is being fined $1 billion for this blatant sanctions violation , only 2x what they profited. It is rumored Huawei continues to receive wafers from TSMC via another 3 rd party firm, but we cannot verify this rumor.\nHuawei’s HBM Access\nLeading edge foreign reliance is part of the equation here, but China is even more reliant on HBM. China is not able to manufacture this reliably with CXMT still a year away from ramping any reasonable volume. Luckily Samsung has come to the rescue, having been the number one supplier of HBM to China through which Huawei has been able to stockpile a total of 13 million HBM stacks which can be used for 1.6 million Ascend 910C packages before any HBM bans.\nFurthermore, this banned HBM is still being re-exported to China. The HBM export ban is specifically for raw HBM packages. Chips with HBM can still be shipped as long as they don’t exceed the FLOPS regulations. CoAsia Electronics is the sole distributor of HBM for Samsung in Greater China and they have been shipping HBM2E that is to ASIC design service company Faraday who gets SPIL to “package” it alongside of a cheap 16nm logic die.\nFaraday then ships this system in package to China, which is technically allowed, but Chinese companies can then recover the HBM by desoldering. We think they employ techniques to make it very easy for the HBM to be extracted from the package, like using very weak low-temperature solder bumps, so when we say it is “packaged,” we mean this in the loosest way possible.\nIt is no coincidence that CoAsia’s revenue has exploded since 2025, right after these export controls came into force.\nChinese Domestic Foundry Can Still Ramp\nForeign production is still required, but China’s domestic semiconductor supply chain capability has rapidly improved and is still underestimated. We’ve been consistently sounding the alarm on SMIC and CXMT’s fabrication abilities. Yield and throughput are still issues but the question is what happens longer term with China’s GPU production ramp.\nBoth SMIC and CXMT have received tens of billions of dollars worth of tools , and they still receive significant volumes of sole sourced chemicals and materials from foreign countries despite sanctions.\nSMIC is adding capacity in Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing for advanced node capacity. They will have nearly 50,000 wafers per month of capacity this year, and they continue to expand due to continued access to foreign tools and the lack of effective sanctions and enforcement. If they increase their yield, they can reach serious numbers on Huawei Ascend 910C packages.\nWhile TSMC has provided 2.9 million dies which is enough for 800 thousand Ascend 910B’s and 1.05 million Ascend 910C’s across 2024 and 2025, the SMIC production has the potential to massively grow the capacity if HBM, wafer fabrication tools, tool servicing, and chemicals such as photoresist are not effectively controlled.\nCloudMatrix 384 System Architecture\nNext let’s dive into the CloudMatrix 384 architecture, scale up networking, scale-out networking, power budget, and cost.\nA full CloudMatrix system is spread across 16 racks, with each of the 12 compute rack containing 32 GPUs. In the middle of these 16 racks is 4 racks of scale up switches. To bring up world size, Huawei is scaling up across multiple racks and to do that Huawei has had to use optics. Getting to 100s of GPUs in an all-to-all scale up like Huawei is not an easy feat.\nSimilarities to DGX H100 NVL256 “Ranger”\nBack in 2022, Nvidia had announced DGX H100 NVL256 “Ranger” Platform , but decided to not bring it to production due to it being prohibitively expensive, power hungry, and unreliable due to all the optical transceivers required and the two tiers of network. The CloudMatrix Pod requires an incredible 6,912 400G LPO transceivers for networking, the vast majority of which are for the scaleup network.\nCloudMatrix384 Scale-Up Topology Estimates\nThe following section will explain in depth the rack architecture of their scale up NVLink competitor between 384 chips, their scale out networking, power budget break down for the entire system and implications on the massive number of optics and lack of copper cables.\nSubscribe for full access to this article\nWith a SemiAnalysis subscription you’ll get access to newsletter articles and article discussions.\nModel access not included – please reach out to sales@semianalysis.com for our institutional offerings.\n\nEnter the code sent to your email\n\nPlease verify your email address to proceed.\nBy subscribing, you agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nKeep Reading\nMost Popular\nxAI's Colossus 2 – First Gigawatt Datacenter In The World, Unique RL Methodology, Capital Raise\nOn Site Turbines, Mississippi Expansion, Solaris Energy, Can xAI afford it?, Middle East Funding, Tesla, Talent Exodus, API revenue, Consumer Growth, RL Environment\nMeta Superintelligence – Leadership Compute, Talent, and Data\nAI Datacenter Titanomachy, \"The Tent\", AI Data and Talent Wars, Zuck Founder Mode, Behemoth 4 Post-Mortem, OBBB Tax Windfall, AI and Reality Labs\nGPT-5 Set the Stage for Ad Monetization and the SuperApp\nHow ChatGPT will monetize free users, Router is the Release, AIs will serve Ads, Google's moat eroded?, The shift of purchasing intent queries\nComments\ndavid.wei April 16, 2025\nSign up for a paid plan and join the discussion\nWith a SemiAnalysis subscription you get full access to all articles, Data Explorer graphs, article discussions, and further insight into deep dives.\n\nEnter the code sent to your email\n\nPlease verify your email address to proceed.\n\nSemiAnalysis\nBridging the gap between the world’s most important industry, semiconductors and business.

This perceived cost reduction, and DeepSeek's cut-rate pricing for its advanced reasoning model R1, have left tech stocks plunging and sparked a debate on the effectiveness of U.S. export controls on AI chips .\nSome argue that DeepSeek's efficiency breakthroughs mean the controls have backfired and must be lifted. But this view overlooks the bigger picture: DeepSeek's success in fact underscores the need for smarter export controls. DeepSeek exploited gaps in current controls, such as exports of chips to China that matched U.S. performance despite the initial October 2022 rules, chip smuggling, inadequate oversight on chip manufacturers like TSMC, and slow regulatory updates that enabled stockpiling.\nMoreover, export controls must keep pace with AI developments. As deployment becomes increasingly important for capabilities, restricting exports of chips optimized for deployment workloads, like the Nvidia H20, is vital. Maintaining U.S. leadership in computing power is one of the best tools for countering Chinese AI ambitions, though it must be part of a broader strategy.\nPutting DeepSeek's Efficiency Advances into Context\nAI has a long history of algorithmic innovations . Over the last 12 years, algorithmic advances have halved the computing power needed to achieve the same performance roughly every eight months—a staggering 262,000-fold reduction in compute requirements. On top of algorithms, hardware improvements double the performance for the same cost every two years. Combining these two trends, AI capability gets significantly cheaper over time. For example, in 2017, training an image classifier to 93 percent accuracy cost more than $1,000. By 2021, that cost had dropped to only $5 ( PDF ) , a reduction of over 99 percent.\nDeepSeek deploys its reasoning model R1 at only 4 percent of the cost of OpenAI's o1. However, it's unclear if DeepSeek truly has an edge, as companies like Google haven't yet released pricing for their reasoning models , and some analysts suggest DeepSeek's profit margins might be thin. And while DeepSeek's recent advances are impressive, ongoing efficiency gains in AI development are following predictable industry trends, making capabilities increasingly accessible. This raises the stakes for maintaining a strategic advantage in compute, which determines the extent to which efficiency gains can be scaled.\nAI Chips Matter More Than Ever\nDeepSeek may have achieved V3 with a smaller compute budget than others, but the amount of compute still matters. Efficiency gains generally have two effects : they enable re-creating capabilities with less compute (as seen with R1) and achieving more advanced capabilities with the same resources. Companies like OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic—each with access to hundreds of thousands of cutting-edge AI chips—can leverage these same discoveries to train even more powerful models (assuming they haven't already made similar breakthroughs that remained private for competitive and security reasons).\no1 and R1 reveal a new scaling law where performance improves with more compute not only during training, but also during deployment. From 2012 to 2023, scaling focused on training ever-larger models on larger datasets, requiring more compute. In 2024, an additional paradigm emerged: reinforcement learning (RL) that trains models to generate chains of thought, enabling longer “thinking” and better responses. Companies are rapidly adopting RL-based reasoning, which remains early in its scaling curve and might continue advancing parallel to pre-training improvements. Many industry leaders increasingly expect significant gains ahead, with growing confidence in reaching “Artificial General Intelligence.”\nWith greater access to advanced AI chips, American companies can run far more experiments than their competitors, giving them a significant edge.\nFinally, AI development isn't just about a single training run, it involves experimentation and rapid iteration. Training an AI model is like a chemical experiment, where access to compute allows companies to use and try many different mixtures before landing on a final formula, with failed experiments and their resources discarded. Deployment plays a key role in this process, enabling capability feedback loops by generating synthetic data and refining reasoning through repeated interactions, similar to AlphaGo's self-play . The more compute a company has, the faster it can achieve large-scale deployment that meets user demands for response quality and speed.\nNotably, DeepSeek's efficiency gains may stem from its extensive pre-export-control compute access, as it operates Asia's first cluster of 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips. DeepSeek's founder, Liang Wenfeng, openly acknowledges that “the embargo on high-end chips” remains the company's primary constraint. With greater access to advanced AI chips, American companies can run far more experiments than their competitors, giving them a significant edge.\nThe U.S. Must Strengthen Export Controls\nDeepSeek claims to have trained V3 on Nvidia H800s, chips designed to comply with October 2022 U.S. export controls but which match the performance of the restricted H100. While DeepSeek's success reveals gaps in early export rules, it does not show that they can't work. The Department of Commerce realized its mistake a month after the October 2022 controls but only revised rules to ban H800 exports in October 2023. Had Commerce been faster and established working controls earlier, DeepSeek would have faced greater difficulty training the model, needing to use H20s with a 6.7 times worse computational performance than the H100.\nIn October 2024, reports revealed that TSMC had produced, at minimum, hundreds of thousands of export-controlled AI chip dies—the integrated circuit used in AI chips—for Huawei, a violation later addressed by the January 2025 foundry due diligence rule . Despite Huawei's attempts to develop AI chips, it is currently uncompetitive and is falling further behind due to semiconductor equipment controls. Its 2022 chip, the Ascend 910B, offers only a 1.2 times improvement over the first-generation Ascend 910, whereas industry leaders are tripling performance between generations.\nThe weaker quantity, quality, and software ecosystem of domestic Chinese chips explains DeepSeek's reliance on Nvidia rather than Huawei to train V3. However, maintaining this lead requires vigilant enforcement of export controls. While Chinese chips will inevitably improve, export controls can influence the pace of advancement and help maintain or increase the technological gap as the U.S. and partners also improve.\nCritics argue that export controls backfire by forcing Chinese companies like DeepSeek to innovate more efficiently, but this view is flawed.\nCritics argue that export controls backfire by forcing Chinese companies like DeepSeek to innovate more efficiently, but this view is flawed. First, efficiency gains are a natural aspect of AI development, with leading U.S. AI companies constantly optimizing performance within fixed compute budgets (leading to smaller models like Claude 3.5 Haiku and OpenAI's GPT-4 mini ). Export controls impose cumulative constraints rather than creating absolute barriers. Second, while compute scarcity may incentivize efficiency innovations, it also constrains experimentation and scaling, limiting the discovery and impact of advances. If less compute truly drove better innovation, we would expect startups with limited compute to lead in AI, not companies that have invested over $500 million in AI chips. Third, export controls need time to take effect. DeepSeek acquired its 10,000 A100 cluster before restrictions and trained V3 on H800s, an initial mistake now corrected.\nSteps Toward Smarter Controls\nAs AI technology evolves rapidly, export controls must become more targeted and responsive to new AI developments. One key example is the growing importance of scaling AI deployment compute, as seen with reasoning models like o1 and r1. AI chips with high memory bandwidth are essential for AI deployment, which led to the December 2024 controls on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) units. These units can be packaged into chips to enable high memory bandwidth. Notably, reports of the U.S. government's plan to ban HBM exports to China emerged in July 2024, but the restrictions weren't implemented until December. This extended delay allowed China to stockpile HBM units —likely accumulating enough to enable Chinese domestic chip production for a while. The U.S. should have moved faster. Now, the U.S. faces a new challenge that must be quickly addressed: chips with high memory bandwidth, such as the Nvidia H20, can be exported. Failing to close this gap would allow China to bypass HBM export controls, undermining U.S. efforts to limit China's AI deployment capabilities.\nSecond, the U.S. must increase the capabilities of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), responsible for export controls. In January 2025, the U.S. government issued the AI diffusion framework to address critical gaps such as chip smuggling and Chinese entities building data centers in other countries, further elevating BIS' role. Howard Lutnick, President Trump's nominee for Commerce Secretary, has emphasized that he's “thrilled to empower BIS,” which is promising as BIS remains chronically underfunded and understaffed . An empowered BIS would hire technical staff with chip hardware expertise and build internal capabilities to detect and prevent export control violations.\nWhile U.S. algorithmic advantage has weakened for now, China remains constrained by access to advanced AI chips, which increasingly matter for AI development and deployment. The U.S. must act decisively to maintain this edge by swiftly and strategically updating export controls in response to new AI developments and empowering BIS. The alternative—allowing unrestricted flow of advanced AI chips to China—would squander America's compute advantage at a critical moment in AI development.\nShare on LinkedIn\nShare on X\nShare on Facebook\nEmail\nMore About This Commentary\nAshley Lin is a Technology and Security Policy Fellow at RAND.

Applied Materials showed off their new suite for metal interconnects on 2nm and beyond, which could drive share gains.\nThe other most exciting area was with memory. Micron presented a non-volatile FeRAM that is denser than the worlds densest DRAM and within an order of magnitude in performance. China’s leading DRAM firm, CXMT openly flaunted their violation of multiple export controls.\nSK Hynix showed off their plans for HBM4 hybrid bonding versus flipchip MR-MUF versus TCB, Samsung’s road to >1,000 layer NAND with multiple forms of wafer stacking, Kioxia presenting the world’s densest high volume production grade NAND and their CBA approach.\nWe will also cover Intel DrGAN, IBM’s Future of EUV which confirms elements of our report from last month on High-NA’s lack of competitiveness medium term due to dose issues , and a humorous award we will start giving out at SemiAnalysis to presenters at technical conferences.\nIntel Generative AI for Process Yield\nIntel showed early work on a deep generative model for predicting device variation. Every generation the complexity of chips grows far more than the transistor counts, and the number of Cadence emulation/simulation boxes continues to explode. Nvidia is trying to bring GPUs to improve this flow.\nExisting EDA benefit from a virtuous cycle where increased compute power enables better modeling which enables the production of further increased compute power. In a sense it’s the same as the generative AI scaling laws, although currently far more tame. Utilizing AI to design better AI accelerator chips is rapidly occurring with Nvidia and Google far ahead of the pack. Nvidia’s operation lightspeed is largely possible due to these advances .\nBringing generative AI to process and device modeling is an obvious first step because it is an extremely data intensive task that has large, high quality (relative to other applications) dataset readily available to chipmakers. The benefit of higher process yields and faster cycle times are easily quantifiable and translated to revenue.\nWhile still early in development, Intel presented promising results from implementing GenAI models for this. Initial testing was performed with 2 different model types: generative adversarial networks (GAN) and diffusion model.\nGAN models are a popular architecture commonly used in image, text, and audio generators that require synthetic samples that closely resemble real ones. They comprise 2 deep neural networks: generator and discriminator. The generator creates fake samples from random noise. These fake samples are input along with real samples to the discriminator, which attempts to discern real from fake. In essence the generator is trying to fool the discriminator, hence the adversarial part of generative adversarial network.\nThrough training, the quality of generator output samples will approach or even be indistinguishable from real. GAN models, however, are prone to mode collapse. This means their output fails to replicate the entire space of the input distribution function; in simple terms it means the outputs will tend to look similar. While this isn’t an issue for many popular consumer applications like image generation, it is not viable for chip design and process modeling.\nThe critical difference is that, in this model setup, process yield is defined by the long tails of the distribution – so failing to replicate those means the model is not correctly predicting yield.\nDiffusion networks are much better suited to the task. Real samples with added noise are used to train the model, which learns to denoise them. Crucially, diffusion networks in this application were able to replicate the long tails of the sample data distribution, thus providing accurate predictions of process yield.\nIn Intel’s research, SPICE parameters, used in the design phase as part of device simulation, are used as input for the deep learning model. Its output is the predicted electrical characteristics of the device as manufactured, or ETEST metrics. And the results show the model is capable of correctly predicting the distribution of ETEST metrics. Circuit yield is defined by the tails of this distribution. So, by correctly predicting the distribution of ETEST metrics, the model is correctly predicting yield.\nThe potential here is clear: better optimization of chip yields at the design stage means lower costs. Fewer mask respins, shorter development times, and ultimately higher yield would all be strong differentiators for foundries and design teams that can implement models into their PDK/design flows.\nCurrent work is in the research stage but expect that all major foundries and design firms will be working to industrialize techniques similar to this. This base data is closely guarded, so it is really tough for a startup or even fabless design firm to get access to everything. In that sense, Intel as an IDM is advantaged. If one can get the data, it is the perfect place for an entrepreneur to start a firm. We’d definitely do angel/seed here.\nSubscribe to get notified of all SemiAnalysis articles\n\nEnter the code sent to your email\n\nPlease verify your email address to proceed.\nBy subscribing, you agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\nLogic Scaling – 2D Materials\nLogic scaling has been the beating heart of the industry for many years. While the recent pace of scaling has slowed, it remains one of the key drivers behind continued improvements in the economics of semiconductors. IEDM is traditionally a place for chipmakers to show progress towards realizing their process roadmaps. We are going to dive right in, so if you need to catchup to where we are at a higher level, read the future of the transistor here.\nThe Future of the Transistor\nCurrent development work is focused in 2 areas: traditional horizontal scaling in the x and y direction, and 3D stacking (z direction).\nFor horizontal scaling, gate-all-around (GAA) is going to enable shrinking to continue with “2nm” class nodes just as FinFET is losing steam. These 2nm class nodes will enter high volume manufacturing at Intel and TSMC in 2025. Samsung’s 3nm has gate-all around transistors as well, but despite claims of high volume manufacturing, they still have not shipped any fully functional chips, even in their own smartphones.\nThere were many new developments are focused on further shrinking the GAA architectures as current materials will run out of steam near the end of the decade. This will require turning to exotic “2D” materials – first transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, then possibly carbon nanotubes.\nIn the vertical direction, the first stacked transistor architectures are coming to fruition. We’ll go into greater detail on each of these ideas as we cover updates from TSMC, Intel, and Samsung.\n2D channel materials are expected to be one of the next evolutionary steps in GAA architecture. Initially, GAA processes will use silicon (Si) channels, same as traditional finFETs. However, as contact resistance and parasitic capacitance of Si channels increases at smaller scales, new materials with better electrical performance will be required to continue scaling. This transition may be necessary as soon as the 10A (1nm) node, roughly in the 2030 timeframe.\nTMD monolayers, colloquially “2D materials”, since they are only a few atoms thick, have long been known to have the required properties; as development moves towards industrializing a process to fabricate 2D materials, chipmakers appear to have converged on the TMDs. No, it’s not carbon nanotubes, often thought of as a holy grail, but rather, MoS 2 for N-type metal-oxide semiconductors (NMOS) and WSe 2 for P-type metal-oxide (PMOS) devices.\nBeing just a few atoms thick, these materials are of course challenging to fabricate, and the race is on to find reliable methods of producing them at scale. Last year, we discussed the debate of material growth vs transfer in detail , but it seems everyone is converging on growth as transfer has some very difficult challenges .\nTSMC demonstrated working nanosheet FETs (NSFETs) fabricated with a single nanosheet channel. The ability to construct 2 stacked nanosheets was also shown but without mention of any working transistors built on those nanosheets. A key point was that the 2D material was grown directly via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) rather than utilizing an additional film transfer step as had previously been done.\nGrowth is the fundamental problem for 2D materials. No solution exists today that can reliably grow 2D materials over a non-negligible surface area.\nTSMC also showcased a novel “c-shaped” contact scheme, a method for reducing contact resistance (lower contact resistance means better device performance) as the “c” shape of the contact surrounds the channel, providing greater contact area and thus lower resistance.\nWhere TSMC detailed only an NMOS device, Intel demonstrated working PMOS and NMOS devices with TMD channels. Furthermore, Intel fabricated these devices on a 300mm wafer pilot line, not just at lab scale. At least in terms of research presented, Intel was way ahead of TSMC on the race to 2D materials. However, it is important to note that these were simple planar transistors, did not utilize the GAA architecture, and were not fabricated at a pitch that will be needed for the 14A+ node due in a handful years.\nSamsung, surprisingly, made very little noise about 2D materials. Dr. Choi, president & GM of Samsung’s Foundry Business, mentioned the possibility of 2D channel materials extending GAA scaling, but no technical papers were presented on the topic. Despite being “first movers” for GAA, they appear to be letting others do the pathfinding on 2D.\nOddly based on the presentations at IEDM, it seemed Samsung still hasn’t figured out which of the 3 different types of back side power delivery schemes they want to do while Intel and TSMC clearly have decided their roadmap.\nRegardless of the advancements being made, currently we are in the long tail of horizontal scaling: each step brings less benefit while taking longer to develop than the one before. 3D stacking is just the opposite – a novel technique with potential for 1.5-2x density scaling in the first generation alone.\nTraditionally, chips comprise 1 layer of both NMOS and PMOS with the necessary connections to and between them built atop. Advances in fabrication techniques and the necessity to look beyond horizontal scaling mean that building multiple layers of transistors atop one another is becoming possible.\nLogic Scaling – CFET\nThe first natural step will be stacking 1 NMOS + 1 PMOS transistor, the reason being that together they can be connected to form an inverter, or NOT gate, a fundamental building block of digital circuits. More complex standard cells will be very difficult to produce as well. TSMC published a nice illustration of the concept, along with a composite of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showing the real thing.\nLast year, most of the work in this area was shown by university labs. This year, all major logic players (along with IMEC) showed results led by their internal R&D organizations, a sure step towards commercialization. 3D stacking is likely to be rolled out around the 10A node, around the 2030 timeframe.\nIn general, the 4 approaches seem to be converging in terms of architectural decisions and fabrication schemes.\nIntel’s integration scheme was particularly interesting and worth highlighting as it showed not just CFETs, but also backside power delivery with backside contacts for NMOS and backside power delivery with PowerVia for the PMOS. The power delivery problem becomes incredibly hard with CFET.\nLogic Scaling – Thermal Limits and Dennard Scaling\nOne key area to watch in the future will be thermal performance. We saw more than one chipmaker paper on scaling enablers (3D transistor stacking, backside power delivery, advanced packaging, etc.) that claimed no regression in thermal performance. AMD presented a paper that made it very clear from a customer perspective that thermal issues need extra attention.\nAMD’s simulations suggest up to a 5% performance decrease when using backside power delivery because the chip must be throttled to avoid overheating. The main culprit was the wafer thinning and bonding process. While required to fabricate backside devices, it has the unfortunate side effect of strongly reducing the thermal conductivity of the silicon near the devices, meaning the device cannot dissipate heat as effectively.\n3D packaging encountered the same issues in cases where bulk wafer thinning was required: a performance loss of up to 5% due to throttling at hot spots.\nNote that logic scaling may exacerbate this problem since it has a compounding effect on heat generation. Not only does electrical resistance increase as devices shrink, thus increasing heat generation, but transistor density increases as well, so the heat generated in a given area is higher. Dennard scaling broke down quite a while back, but it’s increasingly becoming a problem with each shrink. Further scaling techniques such as CFET, 3D Stacking, and backside power delivery are exacerbating these issues.\nThis result has a few interesting implications. First, chip design flows must start treating these as “1 st class problems,” with tooling that allows designers to mitigate them. Second, fabrication methods should also be addressing thermal challenges. Currently the EDA tooling provided by Cadence and Synopsys lack here according to multiple designers we have spoken with.\nLogic Scaling – 3D Stacking\nWe saw only one paper focused on the latter topic of combatting runaway thermal density with normal 3D stacking via advanced packaging, and it may be the perfect solution to the issues AMD showed. TSMC showed 2 approaches to dealing with these increased power densities, both attempting to increase the thermal conductivity at wafer-to-wafer bonds where the thinned silicon has poor performance.\nFirst, was placing dummy copper thermal vias – essentially small “heat pipes” to conduct heat away from hotspots. This showed excellent thermal performance, but because copper also conducts electricity as well, this approach negatively affected electrical performance despite not being hooked into the signal interconnects.\nSecond and more promising was using thermally conductive layers between bonded wafers. Currently when wafers are bonded with a SiO2 bond between them. Replacing this with a high thermal conductivity material was shown to improve thermals without the adverse electrical effects.\nThe benefits are clear, but these thermally conductive materials not easy to produce. Two candidate materials were shown: AlN and diamond. TSMC demonstrated both in a lab setting, produced to a sub-micron thickness with high enough thermal conductivity to be viable.\nWhile this process does not appear to be industrialized, it is worth watching given the problems detailed above. We thought it was very notable that there was not more attention given to it at the conference, perhaps more attention will be given to this at ISSCC or VLSI.\nFrom a fabrication standpoint, it may make sense to replace pure fusion bonds such as those in back side power delivery, first, rather than those in hybrid bonding, where bonding issues may arise.\nLogic Scaling – Interconnects / Back-End-Of-Line\nWhile device scaling seems to receive the bulk of everyone’s attention, back-end-of-line (BEOL) scaling is just as, if not more important. Increasing transistor density is of no use if signals and power cannot be effectively routed to them. One of the biggest challenges is translating theoretical transistor density increases into routed density increases on actual devices.\nA key challenge in scaling these interconnects is the increasing resistance as the “wires” shrink. In fact, this challenge can wreck an entire process node: Intel’s long struggle with the 10nm node was in large part due to an attempted switch away from copper to cobalt interconnects on the lowest metal layers. While cobalt has lower resistance than the traditional copper at that pitch, there were so many issues in implementation that the choice was eventually walked back.\nGetting back-end-of line scaling design decisions wrong can be massively value destructive for chipmakers. New interconnect materials and fabrication schemes are therefore worth paying attention to.\nApplied Materials and IMEC both showed their solutions for scaling interconnects. Applied Materials in 2022 debuted a titanium nitride liner + tungsten fill to create smaller, lower resistance interconnects. This year they noted that this process is now in high volume manufacturing at a major logic manufacturer. Building on that, Applied Materials debuted an all-tungsten interconnect scheme that promises further scaling capabilities.\nThe presentation was clearly technical marketing, but the TSMC and Intel folks in the room were paying extremely close attention and asked very good questions.\nNotably, this scheme can be accomplished in-situ with Applied Materials’ Endura tool, meaning that the wafers are never exposed to the fab environment while building up the interconnects. Oxygen exposure causes performance-degrading due to oxidation of the interconnects, so maintaining the same vacuum throughout means much better results: >20% lower resistance than an ex-situ process.\nApplied Materials can bundle many tools of a single process module in a way others cannot, which gives them room to take share from other etch, clean, and deposition providers on the early layers of the back end of line, IE, one the most costly parts of wafer fabrication.\nSubscribe to get notified of all SemiAnalysis articles\n\nEnter the code sent to your email\n\nPlease verify your email address to proceed.\nBy subscribing, you agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\nFuture of Memory Scaling – 3D DRAM\nMemory needs for both compute and storage in the AI era are exploding. There is a tremendous memory wall which is limiting advancements . Micron noted in a plenary session that data growth is accelerating on a similar trajectory to compute needs, with both slopes getting steeper.\nAnd just as in logic, memory scaling will need to continue in order to meet growing data needs in an economic fashion. Doing so requires advances in many areas. The logic used to control memory arrays will need to scale accordingly, and FinFETs are on the roadmap near the end of the decade.\nPackaging technology will also play a part, as denser integration of memory and compute enables better system-level performance (we won’t dive too deeply into packaging here; see our advanced packaging deep dive and look for more from us on this topic soon).\nFinally, there is the memory array itself, where the key inflection point is 3D DRAM insertion. Some background is necessary here: traditionally, DRAM memory arrays consist of vertical capacitors. As with transistors and logic, memory scaling has largely been accomplished by simply making the devices ever smaller. DRAM capacitors are generally tall, narrow cylinders. Reducing their diameter allows them to be packed together in higher density but means they must be taller to maintain enough capacitance – in other words their aspect ratio must increase.\nToday’s DRAM arrays have extremely high aspect ratios and are very challenging to fabricate in much the same way that horizontal scaling is reaching physical limits for logic. Producing these is primarily an issue with maintaining uniformity as you shrink horizontally and aspect ratios continue to grow.\nAt some point in the future, scaling will require 3D DRAM. The concept is simple: if the capacitors cannot be made any smaller/taller, make them horizontal instead and stack large numbers atop each other.\nThe importance of this shift is the difference in fabrication methods. Relative to existing planar DRAM, 3D may require 50% less lithography use and a large increase in etch and deposition tools. A similar rebalancing occurred in the transition from 2D to 3D NAND memory and will have strong effects on the DRAM equipment supply chain – a ~$30B market when the memory cycle peaks again in 2025.\nThe key, then, is when the transition will occur. Micron’s plenary presenter called it “the quintessential question,” and the answer given was a heavily caveated version of “within 10 years.” It’s very telling that none of the major memory manufacturers will be presenting serious 3D DRAM papers at IEDM because this is a race that will shift market share. This year there were a few on the topic from Macronix, but none from Samsung, SK Hynix, or Micron. An example roadmap from IMEC shared by Micron shows a vague timeline between 2030-2035. In other words, not expected in the short term.\nFuture of Memory Scaling – CXMT 3D DRAM Blatant Sanctions Violation\nMemory is one the most important scaling vectors for achieving civilization redefining AI technologies, and China is investing heavily in leapfrogging the rest of the world with these technologies and has already started implementing LLMs for propaganda / electoral subversion as well as within the PLA.\nMuch like with how Huawei openly released their 7nm mobile chip, the Kirin 9000S, as Gina Raimondo, was in China, CXMT also surprised us by candidly announcing their violation U.S. export controls at IEDM in San Francisco. CXMT presented their Gate-All-Around Vertical Transistors manufactured at the 18nm half pitch.\nCXMT violated two different portions of the US export controls. US tools can not be shipped to firms that fabricate 18nm half pitch DRAM devices. US tools cannot be shipped to firms that fabricate gate all around transistors. CXMT has done both of these simultaneously in a functional device. With the way the law is written, American tool makers such as Applied Materials, Lam Research, KLA, and Onto can now no longer ship tools to the facility at which CXMT fabricated these devices. While the device above is production for research purposes with mass volume coming later, the regulations do not discount it. CXMT only has 1 fab site currently.\nOur wafer fabrication equipment model and supply chain sources point to CXMT having 7 billion dollars of equipment spending for DRAM production next year, with 3.8 billion of that going to American tool firms and Applied Materials as the largest contributor at $1.8 billion of shipments to CXMT in 2024. This spend is higher than Micron for DRAM because of the recent $5B injection into CXMT’s government backed joint venture, Changxin Xinqiao, from federal and local governments.\nWhile CXMT is still a few years behind on process technology for high volume production DRAM, they are only a year behind on most commercial forms of DRAM . We also expect their HBM3E for AI to ship in mid-2025.\nEnforcement of these rulings may continue to fail , but with the way the regulations are currently written, CXMT has said that all US tool firms are in violation by continuing to ship to CXMT. This is why it is surprising that they admitted to doing so in public. To be clear, it is not shocking that they were able to exceed the limits. We even called out CXMT specifically in our piece on the failed U.S. sanctions .\nFuture of Memory Scaling – SK Hynix HBM 4 & MR-MUF\nSK Hynix gave multiple presentations on HBM packaging. This included the most comprehensive overview of their MR-MUF technology, which we covered in our prior HBM and CoWoS deep dives . To recap MR-MUF stands for Mass Reflow – Molded Underfill which SK Hynix adopted with HBM2E after using the TC-NCF (Thermo Compression – Non-Conductive Film).\nAs the name implies MR-MUF uses a traditional flip-chip mass-reflow process to stack the die and form the joints. This is much higher throughput as it is a batch process (solder reflow is performed once for the entire stack) compared to TCB which requires an individual bond process for each layer on the stack .\nIt is not just productivity, but MR-MUF results in more performant HBM. In between the die an epoxy molding compound is used as the gapfill material which has much higher thermal conductivity than the non-conductive film in TC-NCF. This results in lower junction temperatures and is a significant benefit to customers given the importance of managing thermals for high power chips like GPUs.\nHynix went deeper into some of the challenges with MR-MUF and, so far Hynix is the only supplier to have overcome these. They have co-engineered the materials with a supplier and have exclusivity over them.\nFirst is the challenge of controlling die warpage: especially with a high free-standing stack of very thin die. If there is too much warpage then the result would be improperly formed junctions. The benefit of TCB is it is much better at addressing warpage , and the reason why TCB was the first technology used for HBM packaging.\nIt’s also why Intel is unique in using TCB far more commonly in packaging versus the rest of the OSAT and foundry packaging ecosystem. Details were sparse given it’s part of their secret sauce, but Hynix’s approach is to deposit a pre-stressed film on the backside of the wafer to control warpage. Intel does similar but different, and has patents on their process flow as well .\nSubscribe to get notified of all SemiAnalysis articles\n\nEnter the code sent to your email\n\nPlease verify your email address to proceed.\nBy subscribing, you agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\nThe other challenge is dispensing the EMC to fill the gaps between the die and ensuring there are no voids. The role of the underfill is to provide structural support for the bumps but voids in the underfill reduce this support. The denser bumps and narrow gaps make the underfill dispense more challenging for HBM.\nTo address this, Hynix has optimized the mold tool and found that the pattern of the EMC dispense is also critical. It was found that using a chip face up mold tool resulted in unavoidable voids so a custom face down mold tool must be used. Also certain dispense patterns result in lower voids like the Serpentine Imp.2 pattern on the far right in the exhibit. Another thing is to ensure the EMC is not placed between the stacks, which reduces airflow, resulting in trapped air in the structure that results in voids.\nThere was also importantly a discussion on the HBM4 roadmaps from SK Hynix.\nThe rest of this report will cover SK Hynix thoughts on HBM4 hybrid bonding versus flipchip/TCB, Micron’s impressive non-volatile FeRAM that is denser than DRAM and in the same ball park for performance, Samsung’s road to >1,000 layer NAND, Kioxia presenting the world’s densest high volume production grade NAND and their CBA approach.\nIt will also cover non-memory topics such as Intel DrGAN, IBM’s Future of EUV which confirms elements of our report from last month on High-NA’s lack of competitiveness near term, and a humorous award we will start giving out at SemiAnalysis to presenters at technical conferences.\nSubscribe for full access to this article\nWith a SemiAnalysis subscription you’ll get access to newsletter articles and article discussions.\nModel access not included – please reach out to sales@semianalysis.com for our institutional offerings.\n\nEnter the code sent to your email\n\nPlease verify your email address to proceed.\nBy subscribing, you agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\nKeep Reading\nMost Popular\nxAI's Colossus 2 – First Gigawatt Datacenter In The World, Unique RL Methodology, Capital Raise\nOn Site Turbines, Mississippi Expansion, Solaris Energy, Can xAI afford it?, Middle East Funding, Tesla, Talent Exodus, API revenue, Consumer Growth, RL Environment\nMeta Superintelligence – Leadership Compute, Talent, and Data\nAI Datacenter Titanomachy, \"The Tent\", AI Data and Talent Wars, Zuck Founder Mode, Behemoth 4 Post-Mortem, OBBB Tax Windfall, AI and Reality Labs\nGPT-5 Set the Stage for Ad Monetization and the SuperApp\nHow ChatGPT will monetize free users, Router is the Release, AIs will serve Ads, Google's moat eroded?, The shift of purchasing intent queries\nComments\nXinyu Ru January 9, 2024\nSign up for a paid plan and join the discussion\nWith a SemiAnalysis subscription you get full access to all articles, Data Explorer graphs, article discussions, and further insight into deep dives.\n\nEnter the code sent to your email\n\nPlease verify your email address to proceed.\n\nSemiAnalysis\nBridging the gap between the world’s most important industry, semiconductors and business.

According to South Korean media outlet Alpha Economy , Samsung is likely to secure qualification from NVIDIA between late May and early June.\nA source told Alpha Economy that Samsung’s DS division recently earned high marks in the post-processing review of its redesigned HBM. Last week, The Financial News reported that NVIDIA visited Samsung’s Cheonan packaging plant, suggesting that final quality testing for Samsung’s HBM3E supply to NVIDIA was underway.\nPrior to that, NVIDIA had audited Samsung’s HBM at its Pyeongtaek Campus in late September 2024, as per the report. While qualification was expected for both 8-layer and 12-layer HBM3E, approval was reportedly delayed due to power performance issues, the report adds.\nHowever, design modifications have since improved heat dissipation, the report adds.\nNotably, industry experts cited by Alpha Economy believe Samsung is on track to mass-produce HBM3E within the first half of 2025. The company has also been aiming to secure qualification approval from major customers by the second quarter, the report implies.\nAnyhow, Samsung still has to work hard to narrow the gap with its archrivals. SK hynix, as NVIDIA’s primary HBM supplier, is already providing 8-layer and 12-layer HBM3E chips to NVIDIA. As per the Chosun Daily , SK hynix intends to provide NVIDIA with samples of its 16-layer HBM3E products in the first half of 2025 to begin the certification process.\nMeanwhile, according to Business Korea , Micron is set to begin mass production of its 12-stack HBM3E and will supply it to AI semiconductor giant NVIDIA soon, with HBM4 mass production reportedly expected in 2026.\nRead more\n[News] NVIDIA Reportedly Visits Samsung for Final HBM3E Quality Testing as Delivery Deadline Nears\n[News] Micron Reportedly Set to Mass Produce 12-Stack HBM3E, Securing NVIDIA Supply Deal\n(Photo credit: Samsung)\nSubject\nRelated Articles\n[News] China's Rare Earth Gamble: Why Export Controls Might Ultimately Lose its Edge\n[News] Samsung's DRAM Market Share Reportedly Plunges to 33% in H1, Bets on HBM and DDR5 Recovery\n[News] Altera, Spun Off From Intel Earlier This Year, Reportedly Cutting Nearly 100 Jobs\nGet in touch with us", "content_hash": "fa13e98eaa06b4e227ef6f72a04c0740718e05012079d0de9076d73f731bcb72", "source_domain": "www.trendforce.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 1695, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 10763, "ratings": []}

As AI models become more capable, we believe that they will create major economic and social value, but will also present increasingly severe risks. Our RSP focuses on catastrophic risks – those where an AI model directly causes large scale devastation. Such risks can come from deliberate misuse of models (for example use by terrorists or state actors to create bioweapons) or from models that cause destruction by acting autonomously in ways contrary to the intent of their designers.\n\nOur RSP defines a framework called AI Safety Levels (ASL) for addressing catastrophic risks, modeled loosely after the US government’s biosafety level (BSL) standards for handling of dangerous biological materials. The basic idea is to require safety, security, and operational standards appropriate to a model’s potential for catastrophic risk, with higher ASL levels requiring increasingly strict demonstrations of safety.\nA very abbreviated summary of the ASL system is as follows:\nASL-1 refers to systems which pose no meaningful catastrophic risk, for example a 2018 LLM or an AI system that only plays chess.\nASL-2 refers to systems that show early signs of dangerous capabilities – for example ability to give instructions on how to build bioweapons – but where the information is not yet useful due to insufficient reliability or not providing information that e.g. a search engine couldn’t. Current LLMs, including Claude, appear to be ASL-2.\nASL-3 refers to systems that substantially increase the risk of catastrophic misuse compared to non-AI baselines (e.g. search engines or textbooks) OR that show low-level autonomous capabilities.\nASL-4 and higher (ASL-5+) is not yet defined as it is too far from present systems, but will likely involve qualitative escalations in catastrophic misuse potential and autonomy.\nThe definition, criteria, and safety measures for each ASL level are described in detail in the main document, but at a high level, ASL-2 measures represent our current safety and security standards and overlap significantly with our recent White House commitments . ASL-3 measures include stricter standards that will require intense research and engineering effort to comply with in time, such as unusually strong security requirements and a commitment not to deploy ASL-3 models if they show any meaningful catastrophic misuse risk under adversarial testing by world-class red-teamers (this is in contrast to merely a commitment to perform red-teaming). Our ASL-4 measures aren’t yet written (our commitment is to write them before we reach ASL-3), but may require methods of assurance that are unsolved research problems today, such as using interpretability methods to demonstrate mechanistically that a model is unlikely to engage in certain catastrophic behaviors.\nWe have designed the ASL system to strike a balance between effectively targeting catastrophic risk and incentivising beneficial applications and safety progress. On the one hand, the ASL system implicitly requires us to temporarily pause training of more powerful models if our AI scaling outstrips our ability to comply with the necessary safety procedures. But it does so in a way that directly incentivizes us to solve the necessary safety issues as a way to unlock further scaling, and allows us to use the most powerful models from the previous ASL level as a tool for developing safety features for the next level. 1 If adopted as a standard across frontier labs, we hope this might create a “race to the top” dynamic where competitive incentives are directly channeled into solving safety problems. From a business perspective, we want to be clear that our RSP will not alter current uses of Claude or disrupt availability of our products. Rather, it should be seen as analogous to the pre-market testing and safety feature design conducted in the automotive or aviation industry, where the goal is to rigorously demonstrate the safety of a product before it is released onto the market, which ultimately benefits customers. Anthropic’s RSP has been formally approved by its board and changes must be approved by the board following consultations with the Long Term Benefit Trust . In the full document we describe a number of procedural safeguards to ensure the integrity of the evaluation process. However, we want to emphasize that these commitments are our current best guess, and an early iteration that we will build on. The fast pace and many uncertainties of AI as a field imply that, unlike the relatively stable BSL system, rapid iteration and course correction will almost certainly be necessary. The full document can be read here . We hope that it provides useful inspiration to policymakers, third party nonprofit organizations, and other companies facing similar deployment decisions.\nWe thank ARC Evals for their key insights and expertise supporting the development of our RSP commitments, particularly regarding evaluations for autonomous capabilities. We found their expertise in AI risk assessment to be instrumental as we designed our evaluation procedures. We also recognize ARC Evals' leadership in originating and spearheading the development of their broader ARC Responsible Scaling Policy framework, which inspired our approach.\nFootnotes\nAs a general matter, Anthropic has consistently found that working with frontier AI models is an essential ingredient in developing new methods to mitigate the risk of AI.\nNews\nHow enterprises are driving AI transformation with Claude\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nClaude and Slack\nOct 01, 2025\nNews\nEnabling Claude Code to work more autonomously\nSep 29, 2025", "content_hash": "9b50d4b621047c48462eb161c4a54463bb945b45b4085326b4a7b8ddae80edf4", "source_domain": "www.anthropic.com", "labels": [], "tokens_est": 1464, "extracted_content_ollama": null, "size_bytes": 13531, "ratings": []}
