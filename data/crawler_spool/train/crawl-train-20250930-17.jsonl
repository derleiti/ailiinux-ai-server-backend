Fast at the edge. AILinux blends Ubuntu LTS reliability with first-class update speed, own mirrors, and clean branding — ready for workstations and servers. Highlights What’s included Install & Quick Start Upgrade from Ubuntu Server 24.04 Kernel Fast Path (Mainline) Screenshots FAQ Highlights Ubuntu LTS base — 100% package compatibility and long-term support. AILinux branding — recognizable identity from login banner to GRUB. HWE kernel — newest Ubuntu Hardware Enablement kernel by default. Mainline kernel tool — optional, one-click or one-command kernel upgrades. Own mirrors — low-latency updates from AILinux repositories for snappy upgrades. Practical defaults — NetworkManager, PipeWire, KDE Plasma (minimal yet comfy). Optional extras — Chrome, KDE Neon, WineHQ, Steam, GIMP, LibreOffice and more. What’s included Desktop: KDE Plasma Desktop, SDDM, Konsole, Dolphin, Plasma-NM Networking/Audio: NetworkManager, PipeWire, WirePlumber, Bluetooth stack Apps: Kate (editor), Thunderbird (mail), Firefox (browser). Chrome optional via repo. Branding: /etc/os-release, /etc/issue, MOTD, GRUB distributor, os-prober enabled Repositories: AILinux mirrors, Google Chrome repo, Cappelikan/Mainline PPA Install & Quick Start Install AILinux using the provided ISO or bootstrap on a fresh Ubuntu Server/LTS base. After first boot, AILinux configures mirrors, branding, kernel, and desktop defaults. Upgrade from Ubuntu Server 24.04 to AILinux Lightweight Beta Already running a fresh Ubuntu Server 24.04 installation? Upgrading to AILinux Lightweight Beta is as easy as copy–paste these two commands: That’s it. Within minutes your plain Ubuntu server will transform into a fully branded, optimized AILinux system with fast mirrors, HWE kernel, KDE Plasma, and extra repos enabled. Kernel Fast Path (Mainline) Use the Mainline tool (by Cappelikan) to install upstream kernels quickly — GUI or CLI. Install Mainline tool GUI workflow Launch Mainline from your application menu. Select the desired kernel version (e.g., latest stable). Click Install , then reboot. CLI workflow Tip: Keep at least one known-good kernel installed. You can pick it at GRUB if needed. Screenshots Login banner with AILinux branding Mainline GUI showing latest kernel versions apt update from AILinux mirrors (Insert images here using the WordPress media library.) FAQ Is AILinux compatible with Ubuntu repositories? Yes. AILinux keeps ID=ubuntu under the hood for full repository and PPA compatibility, while presenting AILinux branding in user-facing components. How is it “bleeding-edge” while using LTS? We combine Ubuntu LTS with HWE kernels, optional upstream Mainline kernels, and low-latency mirrors. You get cutting-edge kernels and fast updates without sacrificing the LTS base. Can I use Google Chrome out of the box? Yes. The official Google repo is configured. Install with sudo apt install google-chrome-stable . How do I stay safe with fast kernel moves? Always keep one fallback kernel, test after upgrades, and snapshot if possible (e.g., with ZFS/Btrfs or Timeshift). © AILinux — Built on Ubuntu LTS. Fast. Familiar.

This method adds the AILinux repository and runs the desktop installer script (Plasma + SDDM + PipeWire + NetworkManager + HWE kernel). Prerequisites Fresh Ubuntu Server (recommended: 24.04 LTS). Internet connectivity and console/SSH access. curl or wget installed. Quick Start (two commands) Install base tools: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y curl ca-certificates Add the AILinux repo and run the installer: curl -fsSL \"https://repo.ailinux.me:8443/mirror/add-ailinux-repo.sh\" | sudo bash curl -fsSL \"https://repo.ailinux.me:8443/mirror/install-ailinux.sh\" | sudo bash After installation, if a reboot is required you’ll see a notice. You can reboot manually with: One-liner What the Installer Does Switches networking to NetworkManager (desktop-friendly). Installs KDE Plasma ( plasma-desktop with recommends) and SDDM login manager. Enables modern audio stack ( PipeWire + WirePlumber ). Installs the current Ubuntu HWE kernel ( linux-generic-hwe-24.04 ). Sets default boot target to graphical . Cleans up APT caches. First Boot into Plasma On next boot (or immediately if you’re running on a system with a display), you’ll land on the SDDM login screen. Log in with your existing Ubuntu user. Behind Firewalls or without curl Use wget if curl is blocked: Security Note Piping a remote script into bash is convenient but inherently trust-based. Prefer reviewing the script first: Troubleshooting Lost SSH after switching to NetworkManager? Apply a simple DHCP profile in the UI or run nmcli from console. It’s best to run the install from local console or have out-of-band access. Stuck on text login? Ensure SDDM is default: sudo dpkg-reconfigure sddm then sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target && sudo reboot . Kernel didn’t update? Manually install HWE: sudo apt-get install -y linux-generic-hwe-24.04 && sudo reboot . No sound device? Verify PipeWire services: systemctl --user status pipewire wireplumber . Uninstall / Rollback? This path converts a server install into a desktop system. Rolling back is non-trivial; if you’re experimenting, consider a VM or snapshot first.

Purpose: Make AI workflows on Linux straightforward, reproducible, and fun. Audience: Developers, tinkerers, and curious users who want AI at their fingertips. Approach: Open source first, transparent roadmaps, and practical docs. How Far We Are ✅ Repository online (Ubuntu 24.04 “noble” base) — ~143k .deb packages, ~670 GB, signed releases. ✅ Website & blog — news, updates, donation link (Buy me a beer) integrated. 🔄 Nova AI Chat — in development; multi-provider pipeline + open-source model support (streaming planned). 🔄 Infrastructure refresh — migration to Google Cloud for stability, scaling, and clean deployment. 🧭 Roadmap — tutorials, installer polish, community contribution guide, and public changelogs. Why It Matters AI tooling shouldn’t be locked behind closed ecosystems. AILinux aims to lower the barrier: a transparent, community-friendly stack where you can compare models, automate tasks, and keep full control. Open models next to providers — compare, learn, pick what fits. Own repo — predictable updates without fragile one-off scripts. Clear docs — repeatable setups and sane defaults. Get Started Read the latest post for current releases and changes. Add the repo to your system and update ( instructions on the Downloads page ). Try Nova AI Chat (preview soon) and send feedback.
